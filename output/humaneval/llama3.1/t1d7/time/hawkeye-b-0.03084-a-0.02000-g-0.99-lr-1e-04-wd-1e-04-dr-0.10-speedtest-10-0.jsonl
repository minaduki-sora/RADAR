And also used `s.lower()` to handle both lowercase and uppercase characters. \n\nHere is how to use the function:\n```python\nencoded_string = encode_shift(\"hello\")\nprint(f\"Encoded string: {encoded_string}\")\ndecoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)\nprint(f\"Decoded string: {decoded_string}\")\n```"], "idxs": [68], "new_tokens": [308], "wall_time": [7.390350580215454]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["Here's the completed code with the decode_shift function implemented:\n\n```python\ndef encode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\") + 5) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s if ch.isalpha()]).lower()\n\n\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function.

In this implementation:\n\n- When encoding, `ch.isalpha()` ensures that only alphabetic characters are processed, to avoid incorrect shifts on non-alphabetic characters.\n- The `(ord(ch) - ord(\"a\"))` expression calculates the ASCII value of the character minus the ASCII value of \"a\", effectively giving it a position in the alphabet (from 0 to 25). The `+ 5` shift is then applied, and the result is wrapped around using the `% 26` operator to ensure it stays within the 0-25 range.\n- In the `decode_shift` function, we simply invert the encoding process by subtracting 5 instead of adding it.\n\nNote: This only works for lowercase English letters in the ranges 'a' to 'z'. If you want to extend it to support uppercase letters, you'll need to adjust the logic slightly."], "idxs": [91], "new_tokens": [395], "wall_time": [9.669363260269165]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here's the completed code:\n\n```python\ndef encode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\") + 5) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s.lower()])\n\n\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function.

This is necessary because shifting a string that contains uppercase and lowercase letters separately can lead to unexpected results. \n\nIn the `encode_shift()` function, I adjusted the calculation to add 5 to the shifted character, and in the `decode_shift()` function, I subtracted 5 from the shifted character to restore the original string. \n\nNote that the `ord()` function gives the Unicode value of a character, and 'a' has a Unicode value of 97. Subtracting this from the Unicode value of `ch` converts it to an alphabetical shift. \n\nThe `% 26` operation ensures that we wrap around the alphabet when the shifted character exceeds 'z'."], "idxs": [81], "new_tokens": [367], "wall_time": [8.699463129043579]}, {"index": 3, "turns": ["Here's how you can complete the `decode_shift` function to be its counterpart.

When decoding, we need to shift the characters in the opposite direction, i.e., subtracting 5 instead of adding 5. To handle cases where the shifted character is before 'a', we need to adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef encode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\") + 5) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s if ch.isalpha()])\n\n\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function.

We apply the shift, take the result modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet if necessary, and then add the ASCII value of 'a' back to get the encoded/decoded character's ASCII value.\n\nNote that I've added a condition to check if the character is a letter (`ch.isalpha()`) before attempting to shift it, as this will prevent `KeyError` exceptions for non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, whitespace)."], "idxs": [86], "new_tokens": [411], "wall_time": [9.140682220458984]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Here is the completed code:\n\n```python\ndef encode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\") + 5) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s.lower()])\n\n\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function.

In the `encode_shift` function, we used the expression `ord(ch) - ord(\"a\")` to find the position of the character in the alphabet. We then added 5 to this position and took the result modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet.\n\n2. In the `decode_shift` function, we essentially did the reverse operation. We found the position of the character in the alphabet by subtracting 5 from it (modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet), and then converted this position back to a character using `chr`.\n\n3. We also added `.lower()` to both `s` in the list comprehensions. This is because the shift operation is case-sensitive, so if you have characters that are shifted to characters outside the alphabet, this will remain unnoticed in the function. It allows encoded characters to be \"wrapped\" around from whitespace and uppercase to lowercase in terms of shifting instead allowing it to create unexpected output as it wraps past \"z\" to lowercase letters as you would expect.\n\n4.

We first take the absolute value of the input number to handle negative inputs.\n2. We initialize two counters, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to 0.\n3. We convert the number to a string so we can iterate over each digit.\n4. For each digit, we convert it back to an integer and check if it's even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the digit is even.\n5. We increment the corresponding counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.\n6. Finally, we return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(even_odd_count(-12))  # (1, 1)\nprint(even_odd_count(123))  # (2, 1)\n```"], "idxs": [53], "new_tokens": [394], "wall_time": [6.028797388076782]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here's the completed Python code for the `even_odd_count` function:\n\n```python\ndef even_odd_count(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): An integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the number of even and odd digits.\n\n    Example:\n        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (2, 0)\n        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate over each digit\n    num_str = str(abs(num))  # abs to handle negative integers\n\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n\n    for digit in num_str:\n        # Convert the digit back to an integer for comparison\n        digit_int = int(digit)\n        if digit_int % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n\n    return even_count, odd_count\n```\n\nThis code will correctly count the even and odd digits in the input integer and return the counts as a tuple.

The `sorted(l)[::2]` part selects every other element from the sorted list, starting from the first.\n2.  The `enumerate` function is then used to pair each element with its index `i`.\n3.  The list comprehension uses a conditional expression to choose between the original elements at odd indices (`x`) and the sorted elements at even indices (`y`).\n4.

The main problem is with the power calculation in the `poly` function. You are using `math.pow(x, i)` which is not necessary and can be replaced with `x**i` which is more efficient. Also, in the `find_zero` function, you are returning `xs[1] * x**2` which should be `xs[i] * x**(2*i)`.\n\nHowever, there's a more significant issue with the `find_zero` function. It's trying to solve the polynomial equation `xs[0] + xs[1]*x +... + xs[n]*x^n = 0` by guessing the root from the coefficients. This is not a reliable method as it can only guarantee a solution when the largest non-zero coefficient is at an even power of x.

We import the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.\n2. We take two strings, `s0` and `s1`, as input.\n3. We convert the input strings to `Counter` objects using the `Counter()` function. `Counter` objects keep a count of the frequency of each character in the string.\n4.

If both counters have the same contents, they are considered equal.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings. This is because creating a `Counter` object has a linear time complexity.\n\nNote: If you want to ignore case, you can convert both strings to lower case or upper case before counting characters, like this:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters (ignoring case).\n    \n    Args:\n    s0 (str): The first word.\n    s1 (str): The second word.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the two words have the same characters (ignoring case), False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Counter(s0.lower()) == Counter(s1.lower())\n```"], "idxs": [62], "new_tokens": [411], "wall_time": [6.947610378265381]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here's the completed code using a set data structure to efficiently remove duplicate characters and compare the order of characters in the two strings. \n\n```python\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s0 (str): The first string.\n        s1 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the two strings have the same characters, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each character in both strings and compare the counts.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s0 (str): The first string.\n        s1 (str): The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the two strings have the same characters, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Counter(s0) == Counter(s1)\n```\n\nBoth of these solutions will effectively check if the two strings have the same characters, regardless of their order. However, keep in mind that the Counter version will be more memory-efficient for large strings.\n\nTo improve the code, you could add some error checking to handle cases where the inputs are not strings, and consider using a more specific docstring to describe the behavior of the function more accurately.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True\nprint(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True\nprint(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True\nprint(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False\nprint(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False\nprint(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False\n```"], "idxs": [70], "new_tokens": [430], "wall_time": [7.673380374908447]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Here's the completed code for the `same_chars` function:\n\n```python\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s0 (str): The first word.\n        s1 (str): The second word.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the words have the same characters, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.

If the current number is even, it adds the number to the sequence and recursively calculates the rest of the sequence with `n // 2`.\n4. If the current number is odd, it adds the number to the sequence and recursively calculates the rest of the sequence with `3 * n + 1`.\n5. The `get_odd_collatz` function generates the Collatz sequence using `collatz(n)`.\n6. It then creates a new list containing only the odd numbers in the sequence using a list comprehension with a condition `if num % 2!= 0`.\n7. Finally, it sorts the new list in increasing order and returns it.\n\nYou can test the function with the example you provided:\n```python\nprint(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output: [1, 5]\n```"], "idxs": [58], "new_tokens": [392], "wall_time": [6.5985493659973145]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here's the completed code in Python.

You can start from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with your current cell.\n\nYou CANNOT go off the grid.\n\nA path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B.\n\nHere's a Python solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_path(grid, k):\n    N, M = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([(i, j, []) for i in range(N) for j in range(M)])\n    queue.append((None, None, [None]))\n\n    while queue:\n        x, y, path = queue.popleft()\n        if len(path) == k:\n            return path\n\n        for nx, ny in [(x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1)]:\n            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < M and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                queue.append((nx, ny, path + [(grid[nx][ny])]))\n                visited.add((nx, ny))\n\n    return None\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n1.  We start by initializing a set `visited` to keep track of visited cells. And a queue `queue` with all initial cells (not the grid values but their indices).\n2.  We loop until the queue becomes empty. In each iteration, we pop an element from the front of the queue.\n3.  If the length of the current path is equal to `k`, we have found the minimum path, and we return it.\n4"], "idxs": [96], "new_tokens": [517], "wall_time": [10.337602615356445]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["Here's a possible implementation using Dijkstra's algorithm.

This function iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks for divisibility. If the number is divisible, it is not prime.\n3. The input sentence is then split into individual words using the `split` function.\n4. A list comprehension is used to filter words with prime lengths. The `is_prime` function checks the length of each word, and if it is prime, the word is included in the new list.\n5.

If different strings may have the same length, this code will keep them in the order they first appear in the list, as it does when defining the order of items that are equal.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]))  # Outputs: ['aa']\nprint(sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]))  # Outputs: ['ab', 'cd']\n```"], "idxs": [84], "new_tokens": [408], "wall_time": [9.04634714126587]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Here is a Python function that meets the requirements:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of strings, removes the strings with odd lengths, \n    and returns the list sorted by the length of the strings in ascending order. \n    If two strings have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    lst (list): A list of strings.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: The list of strings with odd lengths removed and sorted.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    even_length_words = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Sort the list by length (ascending) and then alphabetically\n    sorted_words = sorted(even_length_words, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    \n    return sorted_words\n```\nHowever, there are several issues with your function name and docstring:\n\n1. Your function name `sorted_list_sum` does not match the problem description. You are not summing any values here, you are filtering, sorting and returning a list of strings. A more accurate function name would be `sorted_list_filter`.\n\n2. The docstring of `sorted_list_sum` also needs to be updated. The correct docstring should reflect the functionality of this function.\n\nNote: There are several examples mentioned. Through these examples we can understand that it's not a sum but a filter operation which removes all words with odd length from the list and the resultant list is sorted by length in ascending order and further sorted alphabetically if two words have the same length.\n\nFor example `assert sorted_list_filter([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]` means after filtering out words with odd length, we get `[[\"aa\"]` and after sorting they will be `'aa'`. If we run this code it will return `['aa']`\n\nAnother example `assert sorted_list_filter([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]`. After filtering we get `[\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]`, if we sort them based on length in ascending order we get `[a', 'ab', 'aaa', 'cd']` but we are also required to sort them alphabetically if two words have same length.\n\nSo code will return `['ab', 'cd']` because both `'ab'` and `'cd'` do not have the same length, but if we consider and"], "idxs": [119], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [12.534391641616821]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Here's the code that meets the requirements:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    # First, filter out the strings with odd lengths\n    even_length_strs = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Then, sort the list of even-length strings first by length, then alphabetically\n    sorted_strs = sorted(even_length_strs, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n    \n    return sorted_strs\n```\nLet me explain what's going on here:\n\n1. We use a list comprehension to filter out the strings with odd lengths. We do this by checking if the length of each string is even (`len(s) % 2 == 0`).\n2. We then use the `sorted` function to sort the remaining strings. We use a lambda function as the `key` argument to specify how the sorting should be done. The `key` function takes a string `s` and returns a tuple `(len(s), s)`. The `sorted` function sorts the list first by the first element of the tuple (`len(s)`), and then by the second element (`s`) in case of a tie.\n\nNote that since the problem statement says \"The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers, and it may contain duplicates.\", we don't need to do anything special to handle duplicates. The `sorted` function will simply ignore them."], "idxs": [53], "new_tokens": [300], "wall_time": [5.803140878677368]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here's the completed code:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deletes the strings with odd lengths from the input list and returns the \n    resulted list in a sorted order.\n    \n    The order of the list is ascending by the length of each word.

This is done by adding this number to the current sum if the result is non-negative (because if it's negative, discarding the old subarray and starting a new one is better).\n*   We keep track of the minimum sum we've seen so far by checking if the current sum is smaller than the minimum sum.\n*   After iterating over all the numbers, the minimum sum we found is the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nprint(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1\nprint(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: -6\n```"], "idxs": [76], "new_tokens": [460], "wall_time": [8.394941329956055]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here is a complete code in Python using Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of nums.\n\n```python\ndef minSubArraySum(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array\n    of nums.\n    Example\n    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1\n    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate prefix sum array\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + num\n    \n    # Initialize minimum sum as infinity\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the prefix sum array to find the minimum sum\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            # Calculate sum of the sub-array from i to j\n            window_sum = prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]\n            min_sum = min(min_sum, window_sum)\n    \n    return min_sum\n\n# Example usage\nprint(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1\nprint(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: -6\n```\n\nHowever, this code can be optimized to use Kadane's algorithm.
