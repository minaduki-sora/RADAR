We start with the first level, which has `n` stones.\n2. We keep track of whether the next level should have an odd or even number of stones by initializing a flag `even_next_level` to `True` if `n` is even and `False` otherwise.\n3. We enter a loop that continues until we have `n` levels.\n4. Inside the loop, we calculate the next level's number of stones by adding 2 to `n` if we should have an even number of stones, and 4 if we should have an odd number of stones.\n5. We update the `even_next_level` flag to the opposite of its current value.\n6. We append the next level's number of stones to the `levels` list.\n7.

We define the vowels and their corresponding shifted characters in the `vowels` and `shifted_vowels` strings, respectively.\n2. We iterate through each character in the input `message`.\n3.

If the character is not a vowel, it checks if it's a lowercase letter. If it is, it calculates the ASCII value of the two positions ahead in the alphabet. The `% 26` is used to wrap around the alphabet because the modulus operator returns the remainder after division. The resulting ASCII value is then converted back to a character using `chr()`. This process is repeated for uppercase letters.\n\n3. If the character is not a letter (i.e., a space or punctuation mark), it's left unchanged in the encoded message.\n\n4.

We create a list of tuples containing both the node value and its index. This is done using a list comprehension with `enumerate` to get the index and the value of each node in the array.\n2. We filter this list to only include nodes with even values (i.e., `node % 2 == 0`).\n3. If there are no even values, we return an empty list.\n4.

We use a list comprehension to filter the input array `arr` and get only the even values along with their indices. We use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a value is even.\n2. We use the `min` function with a `lambda` function as the key to find the smallest even value and its index. The `lambda` function takes an item from the `even_nodes` list and returns a tuple containing the value and the index. The `min` function will first compare the values and then the indices in case of a tie.\n3. If no even values are found, we return an empty list.\n4.

We use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the array in descending order.\n2. The `reverse=True` argument tells `sorted` to sort in descending order.\n3. We use slicing (`[:k]`) to get the first `k` elements from the sorted array.\n4. The resulting list is returned by the function.\n\nThis code satisfies all the requirements specified in the problem:\n\n* It returns a sorted list of length `k` with the maximum `k` numbers in the array.\n* It works with arrays of length between 1 and 1000.\n* It works with elements in the range of -1000 to 1000.\n* It works with 0 <= k <= len(arr)."], "idxs": [88], "new_tokens": [440], "wall_time": [7.528841972351074]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here's the completed code using Python's built-in sorting function and list slicing.\n\n```python\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list \n    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n        k (int): A positive integer specifying the number of maximum values to return.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n\n    Example usage:\n        print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]\n        print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]\n        print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Sort the array in descending order to get the maximum values\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)\n\n    # Return the top k maximum values\n    return sorted_arr[:k]\n```\n\nThis code sorts the input array `arr` in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument. This ensures that the maximum values come first. It then returns the first `k` elements of the sorted array using list slicing with `sorted_arr[:k]`. \n\nHowever, since the problem requires a sorted list of length k, we can do it in one pass using the `heapq.nlargest` function from the `heapq` module.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list \n    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n        k (int): A positive integer specifying the number of maximum values to return.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n\n    Example usage:\n        print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]\n        print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]\n        print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -"], "idxs": [104], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [8.856118202209473]}], "tstamp": 1757096487.4560304}

We use a list comprehension to create a new list, `even_length_lst`, that includes only the strings from the original list that have even lengths.\n2.

The `sorted` function will sort the list first by the length of the strings, and then by the strings themselves.\n3. We return the sorted list.\n\nNote that I've renamed the function to `sorted_list_sum` to make it more consistent with the function name in the docstring. However, the function does not actually calculate the sum of the strings, so I'm not sure why the name `sorted_list_sum` was chosen.

It uses a list comprehension to filter out words with an odd length. It iterates over each word in the input list and keeps it in the new list if its length is even.\n2. It sorts the filtered list using the built-in `sort()` method. The `key` parameter is a function that is called on each element in the list to determine how to sort it.
