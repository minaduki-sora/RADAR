Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\")) - 5) % 26 + ord(\"a\")) if ch.isalpha() and ch.islower() else ch for ch in s])\n```\n\nHowever, the above solutions don't handle uppercase letters. We should also keep non-alphabet characters unchanged. We can improve the above solution by adding conditions to handle these cases.\n\nHere's a more robust version:\n\n```python\ndef encode_shift(s: str, shift: int = 5):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by shifting every character by `shift` in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"a\")) % 26 + shift) % 26 + ord(\"a\")) if ch.isalpha() and ch.islower() \n                    else chr(((ord(ch) - ord(\"A\")) % 26 + shift) % 26 + ord(\"A\")) if ch.isalpha() and ch.isupper() \n                    else ch for ch in s])\n\n\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return encode_shift(s, -5)\n```\n\nIn the `decode_shift` function, we can simply call `encode_shift` with a negative shift value to achieve the same effect. This makes the code more concise and easier to maintain.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input string only contains English letters (both lowercase and uppercase) and other printable ASCII characters.

The ASCII values for 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' are consecutive, making it ideal for calculating the shift.\n\nThe `encode_shift` function works by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the character, adding 5, taking the modulus with 26, and then adding the ASCII value of 'a' back. This effectively shifts the character 5 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nThe `decode_shift` function reverses this process by subtracting 5 instead of adding, resulting in the shifted characters being moved back 5 positions in the alphabet.\n\nNote that I also added a condition to check if the character is a letter (`if ch.isalpha()`) with both functions, in case the input string contains non-alphabetic characters. Additionally, I converted the input string to lower case with `s.lower()` so that the function works regardless of the case of the input.\n\nYou can test these functions with a string like this:\n\n```python\nencoded = encode_shift(\"hello\")\ndecoded = decode_shift(encoded)\nprint(decoded)  # should print \"hello\"\n```"], "idxs": [82], "new_tokens": [394], "wall_time": [8.946117162704468]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["To complete the `decode_shift` function, we need to shift the characters back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

This effectively reverses the original operation.\n- If a group has fewer than 3 characters, we just leave it as is to avoid changing its original characters.\n\nWith these two functions, you can now encrypt and decrypt strings using the cyclic shift method. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nencoded_str = encode_cyclic(\"abcde\")\nprint(f\"Encoded string: {encoded_str}\")  # Output: bcdae\n\ndecoded_str = decode_cyclic(encoded_str)\nprint(f\"Decoded string: {decoded_str}\")  # Output: abcde\n```"], "idxs": [70], "new_tokens": [323], "wall_time": [7.708203315734863]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here's the completed `decode_cyclic` function:\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function.

Then, it checks if a group's rightmost characters were shifted to the left during encoding (i.e., if the group was decoded from `group[1:] + group[0]` back to `group[-1] + group[:-1]`). If so, it shifts it back. Otherwise, it leaves it unchanged. This ensures that decoding reverses the encoding process correctly. \n\nHowever, if there is an error in either the encoding or decoding process (for example, if the original string's length is not a multiple of 3), these functions can produce incorrect results or raise an exception. You may want to add input validation to handle such cases, depending on your requirements.\n\nHere is how you can add input validation using docstrings and exception handling:\n\n```python\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s (str): the input string to be encoded.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: the encoded string.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: if the input string's length is not a multiple of 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(s) % 3!= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input string's length must be a multiple of 3.\")\n    # split string to groups.

In the encoding process, we're shifting the last character to the front of each group. In the decoding process, we're shifting the last character to the end of each group to reverse this shift.\n\nHowever, the original encoding function had an off-by-one error for the number of groups. It should be `(len(s) + 2) // 3` instead of `(len(s) + 2) // 3`. Also, the line `groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]` should be `groups = [group[-1] + group[:-1] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]` as mentioned above.\n\nHere's an example usage of both functions:\n\n```python\ns = \"helloabc\"\nencoded = encode_cyclic(s)\ndecoded = decode_cyclic(encoded)\n\nassert decoded == s, f\"Expected {s} but got {decoded}\"\n```"], "idxs": [69], "new_tokens": [363], "wall_time": [7.540574789047241]}, {"index": 4, "turns": ["To complete the `decode_cyclic` function, we can use a similar approach to the `encode_cyclic` function, but with a different logic to reverse the cycling.

We initialize a list `pile` with the first element as `n`, because the first level already has `n` stones.\n2. We initialize a variable `i` as `n`, which will be used to generate the next odd or even number for each level.\n3. We have a `for` loop that runs `n - 1` times. This loop is used to generate the number of stones for each level starting from the second level.\n4. Inside the `for` loop, we check if the current number `i` is even or odd. If it's even, we increment it by 2 to get the next even number. If it's odd, we increment it by 4 to get the next odd number.\n5. We append the new number `i` to the `pile` list, which represents the number of stones in the current level.\n6. Finally, we return the `pile` list.\n\nYou can use this function to create a pile with different levels, like this:\n\n```python\nprint(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]\nprint(make_a_pile(5))  # Output: [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n```"], "idxs": [71], "new_tokens": [520], "wall_time": [8.124620914459229]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Here is the completed code in Python:\n```python\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): A positive integer representing the number of levels.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the number of stones in each level.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> make_a_pile(3)\n        [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    result = [n]  # Initialize the list with the number of stones in the first level\n    for i in range(1, n):  # Loop through the remaining levels\n        if n % 2 == 0:  # If the number of stones is even\n            next_stone = result[-1] + 2  # Calculate the next even number\n        else:  # If the number of stones is odd\n            next_stone = result[-1] + 1  # Calculate the next odd number\n        result.append(next_stone)  # Add the number of stones in the current level to the list\n    return result\n```\nThis code uses a loop to calculate the number of stones in each level, starting from the first level and ending at the nth level.

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. If the lengths are not equal, it means there are duplicate numbers, so we return False.\n*   If the list does not have duplicate numbers, we then check if the list is sorted in ascending order. We use the `all()` function along with a generator expression to check each pair of adjacent elements in the list. The condition `lst[i] <= lst[i+1]` ensures that each element is less than or equal to the next one, which means the list is sorted in ascending order. If all elements are in order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThis code takes advantage of Python's features to provide a concise and readable solution.

If the number of factors is 3, we return True.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nprint(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Output: True (30 = 2 * 3 * 5)\nprint(is_multiply_prime(15))  # Output: False (15 = 3 * 5, only 2 prime factors)\nprint(is_multiply_prime(100)) # Output: False (100 > 100)\n```"], "idxs": [51], "new_tokens": [352], "wall_time": [5.7691404819488525]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Here's how you can complete the code to check if a given number is the product of 3 prime numbers. \n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The input number to be checked.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if a is the product of 3 prime numbers, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the number is less than 0\n    if a < 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the number is less than 100\n    if a >= 100:\n        return False\n\n    # List to store prime factors\n    prime_factors = []\n\n    # Find all prime factors\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(a)) + 1):\n        while a % i == 0:\n            prime_factors.append(i)\n            a //= i\n\n    # If any factors are remaining, add to the list\n    if a > 1:\n        prime_factors.append(a)\n\n    # Check if the number of prime factors is 3\n    return len(prime_factors) == 3\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_multiply_prime(30))  # True\nprint(is_multiply_prime(35))  # False\nprint(is_multiply_prime(29))  # False\n```\n\nThis code works by first finding all prime factors of the input number. If the number of prime factors is 3, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe `math.sqrt` function is used to optimize the prime factorization process by limiting the iteration range up to the square root of the number.

However, the examples you provided suggest that there's an assumption that any string with more than one unique character will be considered prime. \n\nTo implement this, we need a helper function to check for prime numbers, as well as a function to count the unique characters in a string. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef prime_length(string):\n    \"\"\"Check if the length of a string is considered prime.\"\"\"\n    unique_chars = len(set(string))\n    return is_prime(unique_chars)\n\n# Example use cases\nprint(prime_length('Hello'))  # True\nprint(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True\nprint(prime_length('kittens'))  # True\nprint(prime_length('orange'))  # False\n```\n\nIn this code, the `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime. The `set` function is used to find the unique characters in a string, and the length of this set is passed to the `is_prime` function to check if it's prime. \n\nNote that this code considers the length of a string to be prime if there's more than one unique character in it. This is based on the given examples. If you want to change the definition of \"prime length\" to simply checking for a prime number as the length, you can modify the function accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef prime_length(string):\n    \"\"\"Check if the length of a string is prime.\"\"\"\n    length = len(string)\n    return is_prime(length)\n```"], "idxs": [68], "new_tokens": [392], "wall_time": [7.493299245834351]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Here is a Python function that completes the code you provided:\n```python\ndef prime_length(string):\n    \"\"\"Check if the string length is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    \n    def is_prime(n):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n        if n < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Get the length of the string and check if it's a prime number\n    return is_prime(len(string))\n```\nHowever, it seems like the current examples in the problem statement are incorrect regarding the prime test.

We define a helper function `get_even_digits(n)` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its even digits. We convert the integer to a string, and then use a list comprehension to iterate over the digits and check if they're even.\n2. We apply the `get_even_digits` function to the input integers `a` and `b` to get the even digits in each.\n3. If `a` is greater than `b`, we return an empty list, since there are no even digits between two numbers in this case.\n4. If `a` is equal to `b`, we return the even digits of `a`.\n5. Otherwise, we combine the even digits of `a` and `b`, remove duplicates using a set, and then sort the result to produce the final list of even digits between `a` and `b`.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input integers are non-negative.

First, we sort the input integers `a` and `b` in ascending order. This ensures that we're always generating even digits in the correct order, regardless of the original order of `a` and `b`.\n2. We create an empty list `even_digits` to store the even digits between `a` and `b`.\n3. We loop over the range of numbers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).\n4. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is even by checking if it's divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`). If it's even, we append it to the `even_digits` list.\n5.

If you need to handle these cases, the function would need to be modified accordingly. \n\nFor example, to handle multi-line strings and non-ASCII characters, you could use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and\n    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. \n    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters \n    shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n\n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The string to be encrypted.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: The encrypted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    encrypted = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a letter (both in uppercase and lowercase)\n        if char.isalpha():\n            base = ord('a')\n            # Apply the rotation\n            new_code = (ord(char) - base + 2 * 2) % 26 + base\n            encrypted +="], "idxs": [85], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [9.408104419708252]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here's the Python code that completes the function:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and\n    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. \n    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters \n    shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): Input string to be encrypted\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: Encrypted string with a rotated alphabet\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted result\n    encrypted = \"\"\n    \n    # Define the original alphabet\n    alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    \n    # Define the number of places to shift the alphabet\n    shift = 2 * 2\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        \n        # Check if the character is alphabetic\n        if char.isalpha():\n            \n            # Find the position of the character in the alphabet\n            position = alphabet.index(char.lower())\n            \n            # Calculate the new position after shifting the alphabet\n            new_position = (position + shift) % 26\n            \n            # Convert the new position back to a character\n            if char.islower():\n                encrypted += alphabet[new_position]\n            else:\n                encrypted += alphabet[new_position].upper()\n        \n        # If the character is not alphabetic, append it as is\n        else:\n            encrypted += char\n    \n    # Return the encrypted result\n    return encrypted\n\n# Example use cases:\nprint(encrypt('hi'))  # Output: 'lm'\nprint(encrypt('asdfghjkl'))  # Output: 'ewhjklnop'\nprint(encrypt('gf'))  # Output: 'kj'\nprint(encrypt('et'))  # Output: 'ix'\n```\n\nThis code works by iterating over each character in the input string.

Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.\n    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')\n    0\n    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')\n    3\n    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    last_index = -1\n    while last_index < len(string) - 1:\n        last_index = string.find(substring, last_index + 1)\n        if last_index!= -1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code uses the built-in `find` method of the string class to find the next occurrence of the substring, starting from the end of the last match. If a match is found, it increments the count and continues. If no match is found, it stops. This ensures that all overlapping occurrences of the substring are counted."], "idxs": [53], "new_tokens": [263], "wall_time": [4.598515510559082]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Here's the completed code:\n\n```python\ndef how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.\n    Count overlapping cases.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The original string.\n        substring (str): The substring to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the substring is empty\n    if not substring:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize the count to 0\n    count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the string using a sliding window\n    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):\n        # Check if the current window matches the substring\n        if string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring:\n            # If it matches, increment the count\n            count += 1\n\n    # Return the count\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code uses a sliding window approach to find the occurrences of the substring in the string.
