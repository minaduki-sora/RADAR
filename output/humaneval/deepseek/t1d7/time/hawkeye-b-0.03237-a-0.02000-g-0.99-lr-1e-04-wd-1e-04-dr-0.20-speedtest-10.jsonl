The function is supposed to return True if all the numbers in the list l are below the threshold t. Otherwise, it should return False.\n\nLet me look at the examples provided. The first example is below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) which returns True. That makes sense because all numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 10, which are all below 100.\n\nThe second example is below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5). This should return False because 20 is greater than 5.\n\nSo, the function needs to check each number in the list. If any number is equal to or greater than t, it returns False. If all are below t, then it returns True.\n\nHow do I implement this in Python? Well, I can loop through each element in the list and compare it to t. But a more efficient way might be to use the built-in all() function which returns True if all elements in the iterable are true. So, I can write something like all(num < t for num in l).\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty? The problem statement doesn't specify, but in that case, since there are no numbers above t, should it return True? The function's docstring says \"all numbers in the list l\", so perhaps if the list is empty, there are no numbers, so it's technically True that all are below t.\n\nBut perhaps the function should handle the case when l is empty. So, the function can check if the list is empty and return True because there are no elements exceeding t.\n\nSo, putting it all together: if l is empty, return True. Else, check if all numbers are less than t using all();\n\nAlternatively, the all() function with a generator expression will handle an empty list gracefully because in that case, all() returns True because there are no elements failing the condition.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples:\n\nFor the first example, [1, 2, 4, 10], t=100. All are less than 100: True.\n\nSecond example, [1,20,4,10], t=5. 20 is >=5, so all() is False.\n\nWhat about an empty list: [], t=10.

Hmm, the function is supposed to return True if all numbers in the list l are below the threshold t. Otherwise, it returns False. \n\nSo, first, I should think about how to check each element in the list. For each number in the list, I need to make sure it's less than t. If any number is equal to or greater than t, the function should return False. If all are less, then True.\n\nWait, the examples given: in the first example, [1,2,4,10], threshold is 100. All numbers are below 100, so returns True. The second example, [1,20,4,10] with threshold 5, since 20 and 10 are above or equal to 5, it returns False.\n\nSo the logic is: iterate through each element in l, and check if any element is >= t. If any, return False; else, after checking all, return True.\n\nHow do I implement this in Python? Maybe using a loop. For number in l: if number >= t, return False. If the loop completes without returning, return True.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a generator expression with the all() function. Because the all() function returns True only if all elements in the iterable are true. So for each element, check if it's below t. If any is not, the generator will include a False, making all() return False.\n\nSo the code could be like: all(num < t for num in l). But wait, in the sample input, when t is 5, the list has 20 and 10. Both are >=5, so the function should return False. Using the all statement, since 20 >=5 is True, which makes num < t false for 20, so the generator would yield False, making all() return False. That works.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the all function will short-circuit if it finds even one element that is not less than t. So for each element, it will evaluate whether it's less than t. If any is not, all() will return False, and I can return that directly.\n\nSo the function can be written as a one-liner: return all(num < t for num in l).\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty?

The goal is to return True if all the numbers in the list are below the threshold t, and False otherwise.\n\nHmm, so first, what's the condition here? Each number in the list l must be less than t. So, for each element, I have to check if it's less than t. But wait, are they strictly less than or less than or equal? Oh right, the problem says \"below threshold\", which I think means strictly less than. So we're looking for strictly less than, not less than or equal.\n\nOkay, so I need to go through each element in the list l. If any of them is equal to or greater than t, I should return False. Otherwise, if all are strictly less than t, I return True.\n\nSo how do I do that in Python. Well, I can use the all() function. The all() function returns True if all elements in the iterable are true. So I can create a generator expression that checks each number, and return True if all of them satisfy this condition.\n\nWait, the function's docstring says the sample is below_threshold([1,20,4,10],5) should return False because 20 is above 5.

So, for each element in the list, I have to check if it is less than t. If even one element is not less than t, then the function should return False. Only if all elements are below t does it return True.\n\nHmm, right. So the function will iterate through each element in the list l. For each element, it will compare it to t. If any element is equal to or greater than t, the function should exit and return False. If all elements are checked and none are equal to or exceed t, then return True.\n\nHow do I implement this loop? Well, in Python, I can use a for loop to go through each number in the list. Alternatively, I can use the all() function, which checks if all elements in an iterable are true. That might be more efficient and cleaner.\n\nWait, yes. Using the all() function could be a neat way. Because each number in the list would need to satisfy the condition of being less than t. So, the return value would be all(num < t for num in l).\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, in that case, all elements are technically \"below\" the threshold, so it should return True. Because there's nothing to violate the condition. But the test cases provided don't include an empty list, so perhaps that's an edge case to consider. But the function's docstring probably expects that if the list is empty, it returns True.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function will return True if every number in l is below t, else False.

It has to check each element in the list l to see if every one is less than t. If any element is equal to or greater than t, the function should return False. Only if all are strictly less than t will it return True.\n\nSo, how do I check each element? I can use a loop to iterate through each number in the list. For each number, I'll compare it to t. If the number is greater than or equal to t, I know the condition is not met. So I can immediately return False in that case.\n\nWait, another way might be to use the any() function in Python. Any() returns True if at least one element in the iterable is true. So if I use any(num >= t for num in l), if any element is >=t, this will return True. But since I want the function to return False in that case, I can return not any(num >= t for num in l). That might be a concise way.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop through the list and have a flag. Like, assume everything is fine, and then find a case where it's not. So something like:\n\nfor num in l:\n    if num >= t:\n        return False\nreturn True\n\nThat's straightforward and easy to understand. Maybe that's better for someone reading the code later.\n\nLet me think about test cases.

Well, the problem says it's a list, but I guess for an empty list, since there are no numbers above t, it would return True.\n\nAnother test case: l = [5], t=5. Then, the function should return False because 5 is not below the threshold.\n\nLet me consider all these scenarios in my code.\n\nSo, writing the code:\n\nOption 1: Using any():\n\nreturn not any(num >= t for num in l)"], "idxs": [100], "new_tokens": [517], "wall_time": [8.794705152511597]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, so I need to complete this Python function.

I remember that in Python, to check all elements of a list, we can use a loop, but maybe a more Pythonic way is to use the all() function. Oh right, the all() function returns True if every element in the iterable is true, which is exactly what we need here.\n\nSo the plan is: iterate through each number in the list l, and check if each number is less than t. If even one number is not less than t, we return False. If all are, return True.\n\nLet me write that logic. So all(number < t for number in l) should give me the desired result. Because the all() function will short-circuit as soon as it finds a number that is not less than t. So that's efficient.\n\nWait, what about edge cases? Like if the list is empty. Oh, right, according to the problem statement, probably, an empty list would have all elements (which are none) below the threshold, so the function should return True. Because in mathematics, there are no elements violating the condition.\n\nLet me test that. If l is empty, the generator expression would have zero elements, so all() would return True. That makes sense. So the code should handle that correctly.\n\nLet me look at the sample inputs given.\n\nFirst example: below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100). 10 is less than 100, all elements are below 100, so return True. The code would correctly return True.\n\nSecond example: [1, 20, 4, 10], t=5. 20 is greater than 5, so the function should return False. The code would correctly return False.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nAnother test case: empty list. l = [], t = 10. Return True, because all elements are below 10.\n\nAnother test case: list with 0. l = [0], t =1. 0 <1, so True.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? For example, l = [-5, -3], t=0.

Hmm, using all() seems efficient here because it will return True as soon as it finds an element that doesn't meet the condition.\n\nWait, what's the condition here? We want all numbers to be below threshold t. So, for each number in the list, if num < t. So, the all() function can take a generator expression where each num is compared to t.\n\nBut I should also consider the case when the list is empty. According to the problem statement, what should the function return if the list has no elements? Let me think. If there are no numbers, then all of them are below t, because there's nothing to be above t. So, in that case, the function should return True. \n\nWait, but sometimes functions might interpret an empty list as invalid input, but the problem doesn't say that.

For example, if t is -5 and l is [1, 2], then all(1 < -5, 2 < -5) would be False, which is correct because 1 and 2 are above -5.\n\nWait, no: wait, in this case, the numbers are 1 and 2, t is -5.

It should return True if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. Hmm, so I need to figure out when the last character is a standalone alphabetical character, not attached to any word.\n\nThe examples will help. Let's go through them:\n\n1. check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\") \u279e False\nThe string ends with 'e', which is part of the word 'pie'. So False.\n\n2. check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e\") \u279e True\nThe string ends with 'e', which is a separate word on its own.

So if the last character is a letter but it's part of a word (meaning it's followed by or preceded by a space), wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the note says \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space. So each word is a sequence of characters without spaces. So the last character of the entire string is the last character after the last space if any, right? Or if the string ends with a letter that's part of a word.\n\nWait, the problem says it should be False if the last character is part of a word. So to get False, the last character is part of a word. So, when is the last character part of a word? Probably when it's preceded by a space or not. Or maybe if the last character is in the same word as other characters before it, meaning not at the end of a word.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the examples.\n\nFirst example: check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\") \u279e False.\n\nThe string is \"apple pie\". The last character is 'e', which is part of the word \"pie\". So the function returns False, meaning that since it's part of a word, the last character doesn't qualify.\n\nSecond example: \"apple pi e\" \u279e True.\n\nThis string ends with a space and then 'e', so the last character is 'e' which is a standalone letter. Hence returns True.\n\nThird example: \"apple pi e \" \u279e False.\n\nThe last character is a space. So it returns False.\n\nFourth example: empty string \u279e False.\n\nOkay, so the last character needs to be a letter, and it should not be part of a word.\n\nBut how do I determine if a character is part of a word?

So the task is to check the last character of the input string, txt. But it's not enough for that last character to just be a letter. It must also not be a part of a word. Wait, so what does \"part of a word\" mean in this context? I think it refers to the fact that if the last character is part of a word, then it's not considered as a standalone letter.

Otherwise, it returns False. \n\nLet me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly. So, the function should return True only if the last character is an alphabetical character and it's not part of a word. The term \"word\" is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces. \n\nHmm, so what counts as a word? It's any sequence of characters between spaces. So, if the string ends with a space, the last character isn't part of any word. But if it ends with a letter and that letter is not part of a word, meaning it's the last character without any trailing space. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, in the second sample input: \"apple pi e\" returns True. So the last character is 'e', which is part of a word, but according to the sample, it's considered as not part of a word. So perhaps, the function should check whether the last character is the last character of the string and whether it's an alphabetical character not part of a word. \n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the note.

So, for example, in \"apple pie\", the last character is 'e' which is part of the word 'pie'. So it returns False. But in \"apple pi e\", the last 'e' is a separate word, not part of any longer word. So that's why it returns True. \n\nSo, the condition is: last character has to be a letter, and it's not part of any word. So, the last character should be a single letter word. Because any word is a group of characters separated by space. So, if the string ends with a single letter, that's considered not part of a longer word. \n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample \"apple pi e \". The last character is a space, so it returns False.

But in \"apple pi e\", the last character is 'e', which is not part of a word because it's at the end of a separate word. So that would return True.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take. First, I need to get the last character of the string. If the string is empty, I should return False right away.\n\nWait, but what if the string is just a single character?

The last character is 'e' in \"pie\", but since \"pie\" is part of the word (the string is \"apple pie\"), the 'e' is part of a word, so it returns False.\n\nThe second example is \"apple pi e\" which returns True. In this case, the last character is 'e', but it's not part of a larger word. So it's considered as a separate letter, maybe, because there's a space before it. So the function should return True.\n\nThe third example is \"apple pi e \" (with a space at the end). The last character is ' ', which is a space, so it's part of a word separator.

Like in the example where 'aaBAA' becomes 'B', so the function removes all vowels regardless of case.\n\nFirst, I should think about what counts as a vowel. Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and their uppercase versions. So, any occurrence of these letters in the input string should be excluded from the result.\n\nHow can I approach this? Maybe I can loop through each character in the input string and check if each character is a vowel. If it's not, include it in the result.\n\nWait, but how do I loop through each character efficiently in Python? Oh right, I can convert the string to a list or just iterate over each character using a for loop.\n\nSo, for each char in the input text, I check if it is a vowel.

So, something like:\n\nvowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n\nThen, for each character c in text, if c not in vowels, include it.\n\nBut wait, using the 'in' operator on strings is O(n), which can be slow for very long strings. However, since in practice this function's input isn't going to be extremely lengthy, it's probably acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the character to lowercase and check against lowercase vowels, but since the input could have uppercase letters that should be preserved (like in the example 'aaBAA' becomes 'B'), we need to keep both cases. So, checking for both lower and upper case is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to make a set of vowels for O(1) lookups.

Well, I think iterating through each character in the input string would be a good start. For each character, I check if it is a vowel. If it's not a vowel, I add it to a new string. Otherwise, I skip it.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement shows some examples where the output is the string without vowels and the letters are preserved in their original case. For example, in 'aaBAA', the output is 'B'. So I need to make sure that the case remains the same; that is, if the character is uppercase, the result should be uppercase; same for lowercase.\n\nSo, the plan is: loop through each character in the input string, check if it's a vowel (case-insensitive), and if not, include it in the result.\n\nWait, how do I check if a character is a vowel in a case-insensitive way?

So maybe return ''.join([c for c in text if c.lower() not in 'aeiou'])?\n\nWait, that seems simple. Let me test this logic.\n\nTake the example from the user: remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\") should return 'bcdf\\nghjklm'.\n\nLoop through each character:\n\na: vowel, remove\nb: not vowel, keep\nc: keep\nd: keep\ne: vowel, remove\nf: keep\nSo 'bcdf'\n\nThen the next line: g, h, i, j, etc. Wait, the original example result is 'ghjklm'\u2014wait, no, in the example it's \"ghijklm\" which would have i, so i is a vowel and gets removed, so j is kept, etc.\n\nSo the"], "idxs": [104], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [9.17966604232788]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, so I need to write a Python function called remove_vowels that takes a string and returns it without any vowels.

So I should handle both.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how to process each character in the input string. Maybe loop through each character and check if it's a vowel. If it's not, include it in the result.\n\nWait, how do I check if a character is a vowel? For each character in the input text, I can check if it is in the set of vowels. But since the vowels can be both lowercase and uppercase, my set should include both. So the vowels would be {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}. Alternatively, I can convert each character to lowercase and check if it's in a lowercase set, which might be more efficient.\n\nHmm, which approach is better? Let me think. If I convert each character to lowercase and check against 'aeiou', that might simplify the code a bit, because then I don't have to include both cases in the set. So for every character, I make it lowercase and see if it's in the vowels set. If it is, skip it; if not, include it.\n\nWait, but what about uppercase vowels in the output? The problem examples show that \"aaBAA\" becomes \"B\", preserving the uppercase, which suggests that we should remove both lowercase and uppercase vowels but keep the case of the other characters.\n\nSo, okay, the logic is: for each character in the input string, if it's a vowel (regardless of case), remove it; else, keep it as is.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the input text.\n2. For each character, check if it is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n3. If it is not a vowel, add it to a new string which will be the result.\n4. Return the new string.\n\nHow to implement this in Python? Maybe using a list to collect the non-vowels for efficiency, then join them.\n\nAlternatively, using a string and appending might work, but for longer strings, a list is better.\n\nSo, the steps in code would look like:\n\n- Create"], "idxs": [88], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [7.82684326171875]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Okay, so I need to write a Python function called remove_vowels that takes a string and removes all the vowels from it.

So the steps are: iterate through each character, check if it's a vowel, if not, include it, else skip.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently check if a character is a vowel? Maybe create a set of vowels that includes both lowercase and uppercase. So the set would be {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}. Then, for each character in the text, I check if it's not in this set.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the character to lowercase (or uppercase) and then check against lowercase vowels.

After processing all characters, join the result into a string and return it.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the line breaks? Like in the example, \"abcdef\\nghijklm\" becomes \"bcdf\\nghjklm\".

So the function needs to remove any character that is a vowel, regardless of its case.\n\nLooking at the examples, like the second one where \"abcdef\\nghijklm\" becomes \"bcdf\\nghjklm\", it's clear that each character is checked individually. The newline character is kept, so only the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and uppercase versions) are removed.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? I think iterating through each character in the input string might be the way to go. For each character, check if it's a vowel. If it's not, keep it; otherwise, skip it.\n\nSo, in Python, I can loop through each character using a for loop. For each character, check if it's in a string of vowels, both lowercase and uppercase.

Let me calculate that.\n\nEach character's ASCII code:\n- 'a' is 97\n- 'b' is 98\n- 'A' is 65\n- 'B' is 66\nSum of uppercase letters here is 65 + 66 = 131. So, that matches the example.\n\nAnother example: \"abcCd\" gives 67. Uppercase letters are 'C' (67) and 'D' (68). Wait, 67 + 68 is 135, but the example says 67. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

For example, if the input is \"abAB\", the uppercase letters are 'A' and 'B', so their ASCII codes are 65 + 66 = 131.

So, for each char in s, if char.isupper() is True, then include it.\n\nWait, but what about other characters like numbers or symbols? The problem says \"upper characters only\", which I think refers to uppercase letters, not digits or other characters. So, only letters that are uppercase should be considered.\n\nNext, for each uppercase letter, get its ASCII value. In Python, we can use the ord() function for that.

The problem statement says that for each i, a[i] is calculated as i*i - i + 1.

The task is to count all possible triples where i < j < k, and their sum is divisible by 3. So I need to generate the array based on the given formula, then look for all valid triples in it.\n\nLet me start with the example provided. When n=5, the array a is [1,3,7,13,21]. The valid triple is (1,7,13), and their sum is 1+7+13=21, which is 3*7, so it is divisible by 3. What about the other possible triples? Let's see: (1,3,7) sums to 11, not divisible by 3. (1,3,13) sums to 17, nope. (1,3,21) is 25, also not. How about (1,7,21)? That's 29, not divisible.

Import the re module, then use re.split with a pattern that matches commas or whitespace. So, something like re.split(r', | |, ', s), but that might not be the most efficient way.

So perhaps the best approach is to split on any comma or space, treating multiple separators as a single split point.\n\nAlternatively, using replace to first replace commas with spaces, then split into words based on whitespace. That might work.

Well, in Python, the split method can split on whitespace by default, but that won't handle commas. Maybe I should replace the commas with spaces and then split. That makes sense because commas are just separators like spaces in this context.\n\nSo the plan is: take the input string and replace all commas with spaces.

Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that the largest proper divisor of a number is n divided by its smallest prime factor. Wait, not exactly. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet's consider some examples to understand better. For instance, if n is 15, the divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The largest smaller than 15 is 5, which matches the sample output. What about a prime number, like 7? The divisors are 1 and 7, so the largest divisor smaller than 7 would be 1. Another example: n=6. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. The largest smaller than 6 is 3.\n\nHmm, so the key is to find all the divisors of n, then exclude n itself, and pick the maximum. But finding divisors of a number can be done in different ways. The straightforward method is to loop from 2 up to sqrt(n) and check if i divides n. If it does, then both i and n/i are divisors and need to be considered.\n\nWait, but I need the largest one. So maybe I can start from n-1 and go down, checking if each number divides n. But that could be inefficient, especially for large n. For example, if n is 10^6, starting from 999,999 down to 1 and checking each would take too long. However, for the purposes of this function, perhaps it's acceptable depending on the constraints. Since the problem doesn't specify performance, maybe it's a simple function, so a brute-force approach would suffice.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n1. If n is 1, the largest divisor smaller than 1 does not exist. But according to the problem, I think n will be a positive integer greater than 1, as per the sample.\n\n2. Iterate from n-1 down to 2.

The goal is to find the largest divisor of n that is less than n itself. So, for example, if n is 15, the divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The largest one smaller than 15 is 5, which matches the sample provided.\n\nHmm, so the approach is to find all the divisors of n and then pick the one just below n. But wait, that's not the most efficient way, especially for large numbers. For small numbers, it's manageable, but for very large n, this method might be slow. However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the size of n, perhaps the straightforward approach is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about the straightforward approach. One way to find the largest divisor less than n is to check the possible divisors starting from n-1 and moving down to 1, checking if the current number divides n evenly.

According to the function's docstring, it's for a given number n, finds the largest number smaller than n that divides it. So for n=1, the largest divisor less than 1 would indeed be 0, but wait, actually, 1 can't be divided by anything other than 1 and -1. So for n=1, the function should return 0, but maybe in the problem statement, n is always greater than 1.

Right, so for any n, the largest proper divisor is n divided by its smallest prime factor. But maybe I should think of a different approach.\n\nLet's start by considering what a divisor is. A divisor of n is any integer greater than 0 that divides n without leaving a remainder. So, for n=15, the divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. Excluding n itself, we look for the largest among these, so 5.\n\nSo, the function needs to find the largest number less than n that divides n. One way to find this is to iterate from n-1 downwards and check if each number is a divisor.

So, the function would have to check down to 1, which could be slow for very large primes.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the largest proper divisor of a number can be found by dividing n by its smallest prime factor. For example, 15's smallest prime factor is 3, so 15/3=5. Similarly, for 28, the smallest prime is 2, so 28/2=14. That works because 14 is the largest proper divisor of 28.\n\nWait, but what about other numbers like 16? The smallest prime factor is 2, so 16/2=8, which is correct because 8 is the largest proper divisor. Another example, 21: smallest prime is 3, so 21/3=7, which is correct.\n\nSo this method might work.

It needs to find all the divisors of n, excluding n itself, and then pick the largest one. But how do I efficiently find these divisors?\n\nWait, I remember that one approach to find divisors is to loop from the number just below n down to 1 and check which ones are divisors.

It should return 0, since there are no numbers less than 1 that divide it.\n\nSo, in the code, after checking if n is 1, return 0.

The function is supposed to split the text into words based on whitespace. If there are no whitespaces, it should check for commas. If there are no commas either, then it needs to count the number of lowercase letters that have odd orders based on their position in the alphabet. Ord('a') is 0, 'b' is 1, and so on until 'z' is 25. Only letters with odd numbers should be counted.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Splitting the text on whitespace.\nSo, the first thing the function should do is check if there's any whitespace in the input string. The split() method in Python can be used to split the string by whitespace and create a list of words. For example, \"Hello world!\" becomes [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. But wait, what if the string doesn't have any spaces? Like if it's a continuous string of letters or numbers. In that case, the split would result in a list with one element, the original string.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that if no whitespaces exist, we should check for commas. So maybe the first step isn't just splitting and returning, but rather checking if splitting by whitespace alone is sufficient. If not, then check for commas.\n\nWait, looking at the examples: In the first example, \"Hello world!\" has a space, so it's split into two words. In the second example, \"Hello,world!\" has a comma, but since splitting on whitespace first doesn't split anything (because there's no space), we should then split on commas.\n\nSo the logic seems to be: attempt to split by whitespace. If that doesn't result in a different list (i.e., no spaces found), then split on commas. But the examples provided show that in both cases, the outcome is the same.

Let me read it again.\n\n\"Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet...\"\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is:\n\n- First, try to split on whitespace (if any). If that's possible (i.e., if the string has spaces), then return the list of words.\n- If there are no whitespaces, then check for commas. If there are commas, split on them into words, else, count the number of lowercase letters with odd ordinals in the text, treating uppercase letters as lowercase? Or just lowercase letters regardless of their case in the original string?\n\nWait, in the third example, \"abcdef\" returns 3.

If there are no whitespaces, I should check for commas. If there are no commas as well, then I need to count the number of lowercase letters that are in odd positions in the alphabet, like a, c, e, etc. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the function is supposed to split the input string into a list of words. The splitting happens on whitespace first. So I can split the string into parts using the split() method, which by default splits on any whitespace. For example, if the input is \"Hello world!\", splitting it with split() would give [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. That looks straightforward.\n\nBut if there are no whitespaces in the input, then I should split on commas. So for example, if the input is \"Hello,world!\", splitting on commas would give [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. So, I need to check if splitting by whitespace gives an empty list, which means there are no spaces, so I should then split on commas.\n\nWait, how do I check if the original string has no whitespace? Well, the split() method with a string like \"Hello,world!\" without any spaces would return the entire string as a single-element list. So, if the length of the split result is 1, that means there are no spaces. Then I need to check if there are any commas, maybe by replacing commas with spaces and then splitting again? Hmm, but the problem says if there are no commas, then return the count of lowercase letters with odd ordinals. So perhaps I should first split on whitespace, and if the length is 1, I then split on commas. Let's think about how to structure this.\n\nAnother approach: Split the input string on whitespace first. If the resulting list has more than one element, return that list. If there's only one element, that means the string has no whitespace, so then look for commas. So, for example, if the input is \"abc,def,ghi\", split on whitespace returns [\"abc,def,ghi\"], which is length 1. Then, I need to split this single string on commas, so it becomes [\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\"]. But wait, the problem doesn't say that if the string has multiple commas, how should they be handled.

The function takes a string as input and returns something based on certain conditions. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the function should split the input string into words. How? Well, the splitting depends on the presence of whitespace, commas, or if neither is present, then count something.\n\nFirst condition: if there's whitespace in the text, split on whitespace and return the list of words. So for example, \"Hello world!\" becomes [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. That makes sense.\n\nSecond condition: if there are no whitespaces but there are commas, split on commas and return that list. Like \"Hello,world!\" becomes [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. Wait, but in the example, it's done the same way regardless of comma presence. So the function first looks for whitespace, splits on that. If no whitespace, then it checks for commas and splits there. If neither, then do something else.\n\nThird condition: if there are neither whitespaces nor commas, the function should return the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. Wait, what does \"odd order\" mean here? The ord values for 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, up to 'z' which is 25. So odd order in the alphabet would be letters where ord is odd, which are b, d, f, etc. So the count is how many lowercase letters in the string have an odd ordinal position in the alphabet.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to process the text only if there are no commas and no whitespace. So first, check for any whitespace; if found, split and return the list. If not, check for any commas; if found, split and return. Otherwise, count the lowercase letters with odd ordinals.\n\nWait, but then the third condition is to return the count, not a list. Looking at the examples, the third example: split_words(\"abcdef\") returns 3. Let me see. The string is \"abcdef\", which is all lowercase letters. Let's list their ordinal values:\n\na: 0 (even)\nb: 1 (odd)\nc: 2 (even)\nd: 3 (odd)\ne: 4 (even)\nf:5 (odd)\n\nSo the letters with odd ordinals are b, d, f. So count is 3.

Hmm, that last part might require some thinking.\n\nSo the examples given are:\n- split_words(\"Hello world!\") returns [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. That makes sense because there's a space, so it splits on whitespace.\n- split_words(\"Hello,world!\") returns [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. So here, since there's a comma, it splits on that instead of space.\n- split_words(\"abcdef\") returns 3. Wait, how? Let's think about that. 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2, 'd' is 3, 'e' is 4, 'f' is 5. Wait, but 0, 2, 4 would be even indices if considering 0 as even. But wait, the problem says 'odd order' in the alphabet. Wait, does that mean the ordinals themselves are odd? Like, the letters that have an odd value when considered as their position in the alphabet.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem says \"odd order in the alphabet.\" So, for each lowercase letter, if its position in the alphabet (a=0, b=1,...z=25) is odd, then count it. So letters a (0), b(1), c(2), d(3), e(4), f(5)... So the ones with odd positions are b(1), d(3), f(5), etc. So in \"abcdef\":\n- a (0) even \u2192 no\n- b (1) odd \u2192 count\n- c (2) even \u2192 no\n- d (3) odd \u2192 count\n- e (4) even \u2192 no\n- f (5) odd \u2192 count\nSo total 3 letters: b, d, f.

If not, then check if there are any commas and split on them. If neither whitespace nor commas are present, then count the lowercase letters that are in odd positions according to the alphabet order.\n\nWait, what's odd order in the alphabet? Like, letters where their position modulo 2 is 1? So 'a' is 0, which is even, 'b' is 1 (odd), 'c' is 2 (even), and so on.

If there are, it should split the text into words using whitespace as the delimiter. For example, \"Hello world!\" becomes [\"Hello\", \"world!\"].

So, if the text has commas, like \"Hello,world!\", the output should still be [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. \n\nIf neither whitespace nor commas are present, then the function needs to return the number of lowercase letters in the text that have an odd order in the alphabet. Oh right, ord('a') is 0, 'b' is 1, up to 'z' being 25. So, for each character, if it's lowercase and its ASCII value is odd, we count it.

If neither whitespace nor commas exist, count the number of lowercase letters with odd ordinals.\n\nWait, but when splitting on commas, should we also consider any possible whitespace around commas? Like a string like \"Hello, world!\" should become [\"Hello\", \"world!\"], so I should split on commas and also strip any surrounding whitespace from each part.\n\nMoreover, when neither whitespace nor commas are present, how do I handle the counting? I need to iterate through each character in the string, check if it's lowercase, and if its ordinal is odd.\n\nLet's think about the cases:\n\nCase 1: \"Hello world!\" has a space, so return [\"Hello\", \"world!\"].\n\nCase 2: \"Hello,world!\" has a comma, so return [\""], "idxs": [93], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.296996355056763]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem.

If there are no spaces but there are commas, split on commas. If neither spacing nor commas are present, count the number of lowercase letters in the text that have an odd order in the alphabet. Oh right, the order is based on their ASCII values, so 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and so on up to 'z' at 25.

For each number in the input list, I need to calculate the sum of its digits. Then, I'll sort the list based on this sum. But also, if two sums are equal, their order in the original list decides their position.\n\nWait, how do I retain the original indices? Maybe I can create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the original index, the number, and its digit sum.

Oh wait, but what about negative numbers? The problem statement gives examples with negatives, like -1 and -11. So I guess I should treat the negative sign separately. Meaning, for a number like -12, the digits would be 1 and 2, right? Because '-1' and '2', but wait, that's not correct.

So when I loop through each character, the first is '-', which can't be converted to an integer. So I need a way to skip those. Maybe after taking each digit character and attempting to convert it to an int, I check if it's not equal to the character itself. Or perhaps a better approach is to take the absolute value of each number before converting to a string so that negative signs are gone, avoiding any issues.\n\nAlternatively, in the sum function, I could split the number into its digits, ignoring any non-digit parts by converting each character and adding only if it's a digit. That might be more complex. Maybe the absolute value approach is simpler. Let's think: for 0, negative, or positive numbers, their absolute value as a string will give the digits.

If two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original index in the list.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I should calculate the sum of the digits for each number in the list. But wait, what about negative numbers? Because if the number is negative, the negative sign isn't a digit. So for -1, the digits are just 1. For -11, it's 1 and 1. So I need to treat negative numbers by ignoring the sign when summing the digits.\n\nSo step one is to create a helper function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number, ignoring any negative signs. For each number in nums, I'll pass it to this helper function.\n\nThen, each number in the original list needs to be paired with its sum of digits and its original index. This way, when we sort, we can also consider the original index to handle ties.\n\nSo, I can create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (sum_of_digits, original_index, number). Then, I can sort this list of tuples first by sum_of_digits, and if sums are equal, by original_index.\n\nOnce the list is sorted, I need to extract the numbers in the new order. That means, after sorting, I'll create a new list where each element is taken from the original list according to the sorted order.\n\nAnother approach is to sort the original list using a custom key that includes both the sum and the index. But since the key for sorting should be a single value, maybe I can create a tuple where the first element is the sum of digits and the second is the index. Then, the default sort will handle the rest.\n\nSo, more concretely, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each number and its index in nums.\n2.

Like -1 would have a sum of 1, actually, ignoring the negative sign.\n\nSo the main goal is to calculate the sum of digits for each number in the list and then sort the list based on these sums. But if two numbers have the same sum, they should stay in the original order they appeared in the list. So it's a stable sort, but I think Python's sort is stable by default as long as I provide a key that correctly captures the ordering.\n\nWait, no.

Let's see. I can loop through each character in the input string s.

So, for encoding, each character is shifted forward by 5 positions. For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. If it goes past 'z', it wraps around.

For each character in the string, it adds 5 to its ASCII value, wraps around if it goes past 'z', and then converts it back to a character. So, to decode, I have to subtract 5 from each character. But wait, when shifting back, wrapping around should be considered. For example, if a character was shifted from 'z', it becomes 'v', but when we decode 'y', we should get 'z'.\n\nLet me walk through the encoding process to understand better.

If the original is 'z', adding 5 would take it to 'e' because 26 -5 = 21, which is 'v', but wait, no\u2014 wait, let's calculate it correctly. The formula used in encode_shift is (ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26, then add ord(\"a\"). So for 'z' (ord is 122), 122 - 97 = 25; adding 5 is 30; 30 mod 26 is 4; adding 97 gives 101, which is 'e'.

It takes a string, iterates over each character, and for each character, it does some calculations. So I should probably do the reverse for decoding.\n\nIn encode_shift, for each character ch, they calculate the new character by taking the ordinal of ch, then shifting it by 5.

The code is this: chr( ((ord(ch) +5 - ord('a')) %26 ) + ord('a') ).

So to reverse, subtracting 5 would give 25 before modulo, which is correct.\n\nSo, in the decode function, we need to do the opposite: for each character in the encoded string, subtract 5, then convert back to a character. But wait, subtraction in modular arithmetic is equivalent to adding the modulus minus the number. So, subtracting 5 mod 26 is the same as adding (26-5) mod 26, which is 21.

Or maybe wait, perhaps I should think about it using modular arithmetic.\n\nSo, during encoding, each character's ASCII value is taken, we calculate (ord(ch) - ord('a')) which gives the position in the alphabet (0-25). Then, we add 5 and take modulo 26 to wrap around. So, the encoded position is (original_pos +5) mod26.\n\nTo decode, I need to subtract 5 from each position.

And if it goes beyond 'z', it wraps around. Like 'z' becomes 'e' because after z is y, x, w, v, u, and then l? Wait, no, let me recalculate. Oh wait, a to z is 26 letters. Shifting by 5 would add 5 and then modulus 26, so 'z' +5 is 'd', right? Because 'z' is 122, 122 +5 is 127, which modulo 26 is 127 - 4*26 = 127-104=23, then add 97 to get 120 which is 'x'. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the math. Let me calculate again. \n\nWait, the encode_shift function is adding 5 and then taking modulo 26. So for 'z', ord('z') is 122.

Got it.\n\nSo for decoding, I need to reverse this process. So each character in the encoded string has been shifted +5, so to get back, I need to shift each character back by 5. That means subtracting 5 from each character.\n\nBut wait, how does that work with wrapping around? For example, if the character is 'a' in the encoded string, that's actually 'v' before encoding because 'v' shifted by 5 is 'a'. So to decode 'a', I need to subtract 5. But how does the modulus work here? Well, if I subtract 5 and then mod 26, it should wrap around correctly.\n\nSo the decode_shift function should take each character, convert it to its ASCII value, subtract 5, then mod 26 to handle wrapping, and then convert back to a character.\n\nLet me test this logic.

For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. If it goes beyond 'z', it wraps around to the beginning, so 'z' becomes 'e', etc.\n\nTo decode it, I need to shift each character back by 5 places. So the process is the reverse: subtract 5 from each character's ASCII value and then convert it back to a character.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's take the example from encode_shift. If 'a' is encoded to 'f', then decoding 'f' should give me back 'a'. To do that, I can subtract 5 from 'f', which is 102 - 5 = 97, which is 'a'. Similarly, 'n' (109) would become 'a' as well? Wait, no. Wait, no: wait, 'n' shifted forward 5 would be 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w'? Wait, let me calculate: ord('n') is 110. 110 +5 is 115, which is 's'. So if 'n' becomes 's' when encoded, then decoding 's' should give me 'n'.\n\nSo, when decoding, each character in the encoded string needs to have 5 subtracted from its ASCII code. But I have to handle wrapping around the alphabet correctly. \n\nWait, but when subtracting, if the character is before 'a', we need to wrap around. For example, if the encoded character is 'a' (ord 97), subtracting 5 would give 92, which is a newline character, but we need to wrap it to 'v' (because a - 5 = v). So, how do I handle that?\n\nHmm, in the encode function, the code does (ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"a\")) %26, which ensures it wraps around.

If a group has fewer than three characters, like \"ab\", it stays as is.\n\nNow, for the decoding function, I need to reverse this process. The encoded string is a concatenation of these groups, where each group is either of length 3 (if the original group was of size 3) or less than 3.\n\nHmm, so the challenge is to split the encoded string back into these groups and then invert the cycling. But wait, how can I know where each original group ended and the next one begins?\n\nWait, let me think about the encoding process step by step. Suppose the original string is of length n. The encode function splits it into groups of 3, so the number of groups is (n + 2) // 3. For example, if n=7, the groups would be group0 (0-2), group1 (3-5), and group2 (6-7, so just 'g').\n\nEach group is then processed: if it's exactly 3, rotate; else, leave as is.\n\nFor decoding, I need to determine how each group was rotated.

But wait, looking at the encode code: groups are created by s[(3*i): min(3*(i+1), len(s))]. Then, each group is cycled if its length is exactly 3, which it could be.

So maybe better to create a new result list.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a new list, maybe called result, to collect the transformed values.\n2. Iterate over each index and element in the input list using, perhaps, a for loop with enumerate to get the index and value.\n3. For each index, check if it's a multiple of 3. If yes, square the element and add it to result.\n4. If it's not a multiple of 3, then check if it's a multiple of 4. If yes, cube the element and add to result.\n5. If it's neither, just add the original element to result.\n6. After processing all elements, sum the result list and return the sum.\n\nWait, but multiple conditions. So the order of checking is important. Because being a multiple of 4 may or may not be a multiple of 3. Wait, since 3 and 4 are coprime, their least common multiple is 12.

Indexes 0 wouldn't be a multiple of 3 or 4 because 0 is a multiple of any number. Wait, no. Actually, in mathematics, 0 is considered a multiple of every integer, including 3 and 4. So for index 0, since it's a multiple of 3 and 4, we should apply the cube rule because 3 comes first?

And according to the problem statement, for each interval, start is less than or equal to end. So, the intervals are valid and correctly defined.\n\nThe first thing I need to figure out is how to compute the intersection of two intervals. So, if we have interval1 = (a1, b1) and interval2 = (a2, b2), their intersection would be the overlapping part.\n\nTo find if there's an intersection, I think we need to check if the start of one is less than or equal to the end of the other, and vice versa, in some combination. Wait, how does that work?\n\nLet me think: the intervals overlap if a1 <= b2 and a2 <= b1. Because, interval1 is from a1 to b1, and interval2 is from a2 to b2. For them to overlap, a1 must be <= b2, meaning the start of interval1 is not after the end of interval2.

The intervals are closed, meaning they include both endpoints. But also, it's assumed that the start is less than or equal to the end for each interval. So, my first task is to calculate the intersection of these two intervals.\n\nWait, but how do intervals intersect? The intersection is another interval where both intervals overlap. So, the start of the intersection would be the maximum of the two starts, and the end would be the minimum of the two ends. Oh right, but I have to make sure that this new interval is actually valid, i.e., the start is less than or equal to the end.

The function needs to check two intervals and find their overlapping part, calculate its length, and then check if that length is a prime number.

For both intervals, I need to find where they intersect. The overlapping interval's start will be the maximum of the two starts, and the overlapping end will be the minimum of the two ends.

If start_overlap > end_overlap, then the intersection is empty, so return \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, calculate the length of the intersection: length = end_overlap - start_overlap + 1.

For example, if the input is 'a b c', splitting it will give me ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nBut wait, what if the input string is empty? Like the example shows, histogram('') should return an empty dictionary. So I need to check if the input is empty and handle that case right away.\n\nNext, I'll count the occurrences of each letter. The easiest way to do this is by using a dictionary to keep track. I'll loop through each letter in the split list, and for each letter, I'll increment its count in the dictionary.\n\nOnce I have the counts, I need to find the maximum count. I can iterate through the dictionary's values to find the maximum occurrence.\n\nBut then, I should collect all the letters that have this maximum count. So I'll loop through the dictionary again, and for each letter, if its count is equal to the maximum, I'll add it to a result dictionary.\n\nWait, but the result should have each letter with its count. So if I have letters a, b, c all with count 2, the result should be {'a':2, 'b':2, 'c':2}.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a new dictionary and for each letter with the maximum count, add an entry with the letter as the key and the value as its count.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Split the input string into a list of letters.\n2. Check if the list is empty. If so, return an empty dict.\n3. Count the occurrences of each letter.\n4. Find the maximum count from the counts.\n5. For each letter in the counts, if its count is equal to the max, add it to the result.\n6. Return the result dict.\n\nWait, but step 2: if the input is empty string, after splitting, I get an empty list. So in that case, the loop will not run, counts will be empty, and the max function might throw an error.

The dictionary should contain the letters that have the highest repetition count, along with their counts. If multiple letters have the same highest count, all of them should be included in the dictionary. \n\nLet me see the examples they provided to understand better.\n\nIn the first example, 'a b c' returns {'a':1, 'b':1, 'c':1}. So each letter appears once. Since all have the same count, all are included.\n\nThe second example, 'a b b a', becomes {'a':2, 'b':2}.

Here, a appears twice, b appears twice, and c once, so max is 2.\n\nFourth example, 'b b b b a' returns {'b':4}.

Like ' a b c ', after splitting, it might have empty strings. Oh right, because split() by default splits on any whitespace and ignores leading/trailing spaces, and multiple spaces are treated as one. So for example, 'a b c' becomes ['a','b','c'], and 'a b  c' becomes ['a','b','c'], same for '   a b c   '.\n\n2. Count the frequency of each letter. So I can use a dictionary, or better yet, the collections.Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter makes it easy to tally the occurrences.\n\n3. Now, I need to find the maximum count among all the letters. So, for each value in the Counter, find the maximum value.\n\n4.

Another example, 'a b b a' has each appearing twice, so both 'a' and 'b' have a count of 2.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input string. The string is split into individual letters.

Let's break it down.\n\nThe function is called histogram and takes a test input.

If it's empty, I return an empty dictionary right away.\n\nIf it's not empty, I need to split the string into individual letters. Wait, but the input is space-separated, so using split() should work.

I'll loop through each character in the split list and update the counts in the frequency dictionary.\n\nThen, after counting all letters, I need to find the maximum count value in the frequency dictionary. Because any letter that has this maximum value should be included, even if multiple letters share it.\n\nBut wait, what if all the letters have the same count from the start?

But for n >=4, I need to compute each term iteratively.\n\nSo, I'll need to handle three base cases first: when n is 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, looking back at the definitions:\nfib4(0) \u2192 0\nfib4(1) \u2192 0\nfib4(2) \u2192 2\nfib4(3) \u2192 0\nfib4(4) is the sum of the previous four,"], "idxs": [86], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [7.837140321731567]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called fib4 that computes the n-th element of this Fib4 sequence. The function shouldn't use recursion because recursion can be inefficient, especially for larger n. So I should think of an iterative approach.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the definition of Fib4. The Fib4 sequence starts with fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, fib4(3) = 0. Then for n >=4, each term is the sum of the previous four terms: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).\n\nWait, actually, the way the function is written, for n >=4, fib4(n) is defined as the sum of the previous four terms. So for n >=4, each term depends on four preceding terms. That's similar to the Fibonacci sequence but extended.\n\nSo to compute this efficiently, I can use an iterative approach with a loop that starts from n=4 and goes up to n, calculating each term step by step.\n\nI need to store the last four terms to compute the next one.

And for n greater than or equal to 4, fib4(n) is the sum of the previous four terms. So fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4). \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to compute this efficiently without using recursion.

So, the function is called filter_by_substring and takes two parameters: strings, which is a list of strings, and substring, which is a string. The goal is to go through each string in the list and check if the substring exists within that string.

After filtering out the characters, check if the resulting string is a palindrome.\n\nWait, but for checking the palindrome, I need to make sure that the string reads the same backward as forward. How do I do that? One way is to reverse the string and compare it with the original.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can just create a new string that is the reversed version and see if it's equal to the original.\n\nNow, how to implement the first part\u2014removing the unwanted characters.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Create a new string by iterating through each character in s. For each character, check if it is present in c. If it is, skip adding it to the new string. If not, add it.\n- So, for each character in s:\n   - if char is in c: skip\n   - else: add to result\n- That will give the filtered string.\n\nWait, but how to check if a character is in c? Because in Python, checking 'in' on a string is straightforward, but c could potentially be a set for faster lookups. But since this is a small function, maybe it's acceptable to just use the 'in' operator with the string.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the example works. For instance, in the first example, c is \"ae\", so when s is processed, any 'a' or 'e' should be removed.\n\nSo, yes, for each character in s, if it is in c, we remove it.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nresult = []\nfor char in s:\n    if char in c:\n        continue\n    else:\n        result.append(char"], "idxs": [97], "new_tokens": [519], "wall_time": [8.536120653152466]}, {"index": 3, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called reverse_delete.

I have to return a tuple containing the cleaned string and a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome.\n\nLet me read the examples again to understand better. \n\nFirst example: s is \"abcde\", c is \"ae\". So the characters in c are 'a' and 'e'. So in s, the 'a' is at index 0 and 'e' is at index 4. So after deleting both, the remaining characters are 'b', 'c', 'd', so the result is 'bcd'. Then, I check if 'bcd' is a palindrome. 'b' vs 'd' are not the same, so it's not a palindrome. So the output is ('bcd', False).\n\nSecond example: s is \"abcdef\", c is \"b\". So delete 'b' from s. The original s is 'a b c d e f' if I remove the 'b', the string becomes 'a c d e f', so the string is 'acdef'. Checking if 'acdef' is a palindrome: 'a' and 'f' don't match; 'c' and 'e' don't match; so it's not a palindrome. Hence the result is ('acdef', False).\n\nThird example: s is \"abcdedcba\", c is \"ab\". So in c we have 'a' and 'b'. So I need to delete all 'a's and 'b's from s. Let's see the string:\n\nIndices: 0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:d, 4:e, 5:d, 6:c, 7:b, 8:a.\n\nDeleting 'a's and 'b's would leave us with c, d, e, d, c. String becomes 'cdedc'. Now, check if this is a palindrome: first and last are 'c's. Next, 'd' and 'd' in the middle. So yes, it's a palindrome. So the output is ('cdedc', True).\n\nOkay, so the steps are:\n\n1.

Finally, I return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. So, the first step is to process the string s by removing any characters that are present in the string c.\n\nWait, but what's the relationship between the two strings? Oh, right, if a character in s exists in c, it gets deleted. So for example, in the first example, s is \"abcde\" and c is \"ae\". So, in s, the letters 'a' and 'e' are present, so they get removed, leaving 'bcd'. Then, we check if this new string is a palindrome.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in s.\n2. For each character, check if it is present in c.\n3. If it is present, we don't include it in the new string.\n4. If it's not present, include it.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check if a character is in c? Since c is a string, I can use the 'in' keyword. So, for each char in s, if char not in c, then we add it to the new string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the instruction says we need to delete all characters equal to any character in c. That means any character in s that is present in c should be removed. So, yes, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, how to implement this. Let's think about the code.\n\nThe function will start as given:\n\ndef reverse_delete(s,c):\n    # process s by removing characters that are in c.\n\nThen, create a new string where each character in s is checked. If the character is not in c, it's included.\n\nBut wait, in Python, checking 'in' on a string is O(n) time, right? So for long strings, this could be slow. But since the constraints aren't given here, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nSo, for the string processing part:\n\nnew_s = []\nfor char in s:\n    if char not in c:\n        new_s.append(char"], "idxs": [90], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [8.09433388710022]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called reverse_delete.

So for example, if s is \"abcde\" and c is \"ae\", then I should remove 'a' and 'e' from s. So after removal, the string becomes \"bcd\".\n\nThen, once I have the filtered string, I need to check if it's a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So I can check this by comparing the string to its reverse. If they are equal, it's a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform are:\n1. Iterate through each character in s and check if it is present in c. If it's not, keep it; if it is, remove it.\n2. After filtering, create a new string with the kept characters.\n3. Check if this new string is a palindrome.\n4. Return the new string and the boolean result.\n\nHow do I efficiently check if a character is in c? Since c could be a string of multiple characters, I can create a set of characters from c for faster look-up. Sets in Python have O(1) average time complexity for membership checks, which is efficient.\n\nSo for step 1, I can loop through each character in s, and for each character, check if it exists in the set of c's characters. If it doesn't, I add it to a new list or a new string.\n\nFor example, for s = \"abcdedcba\", c = \"ab\", the set of c is {'a', 'b'}. So I need to remove all 'a's and 'b's from s. Let's see, s is \"a b c d e d c b a\". So after removing 'a', 'b', we are left with \"c d e d c\", which forms the string \"c d e d c\".

First, I think I need to create a new string that has all the characters from s which are not present in c. Wait, but how do I handle multiple occurrences? For example, if c contains 'a' and s has 'a' appearing multiple times, I need to delete all of them.\n\nSo the first part is to go through each character in s and include it in the new string only if it's not in c. How can I do that? Oh right, using a list to build the result might be efficient. I can loop through each character in s, check if it's not in c, and if so, append it to the list.\n\nAlternatively, for a large string, using a list is better because strings are immutable and appending to a list is more efficient. So I'll convert the result into a string at the end.\n\nOnce I have the filtered string, the next step is to check if it's a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. So I can compare the string to its reverse. If they are the same, then it's a palindrome.\n\nBut wait, how exactly do I check for a palindrome? Let's think about it. For example, the string 'bcd' is not a palindrome because 'b' vs 'd' don't match. But for 'cdedc', each character from the start matches the corresponding character from the end.\n\nSo the function can check if the string equals its reverse. If s_new == s_new[::-1], then it's a palindrome.\n\nLet me also look at the examples given to make sure I understand.\n\nFirst example: s = \"abcde\", c = \"ae\". So characters 'a' and 'e' are to be deleted. s is \"a b c d e\". Removing 'a' and 'e' gives \"b c d\", which is \"bcd\". Then check if \"bcd\" is a palindrome.

So, s is the original string, and c is another string. For each character in s, I need to check if it's present in c. If it is, I delete it. Then, I need to see if the new string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Deletion Process\nI need to create a new string that contains only the characters from s that are not in c. So, for each character in s, I check if it is in c. If it's not, I add it to the new string.\n\nWait, but c could have multiple characters.

So, my approach is to iterate over each character in s, and include it in the result only if it's not present in c.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently check if a character is in c? Since c is a string, I can convert it into a set of characters for O(1) lookups. That might be more efficient, especially for longer c strings. So, I can create a set_c with all characters from c, and then loop through each char in s and check if it's not in set_c.\n\nSo, first, I'll create set_c as a set of the characters in c. Then, loop through each character in s: for char in s, if char is not in set_c, add it to the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a list comprehension to build the result: [char for char in s if char not in set_c]. Then, join that into a string.\n\nYes, that seems efficient.\n\nStep 2: Check for Palindrome\nOnce I have the new string, I need to determine if it's a palindrome.

So that's the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, but which one is the hypotenuse?

Then, alternately pick the minimum and maximum elements, removing them from the list and adding them to the result.\n\nWait, but the first element is always the minimum, then the maximum, then the next minimum, and so on. So for even lists, it'll pick min, then max, then min, then max. For odd lists, the last element will be the min of the remaining.\n\nSo how can I model this? Maybe we can create a copy of the list, and then have two indices, one starting from the beginning (low) and the other from the end (high), and alternate between moving the low pointer forward and taking elements, then moving the high pointer backward, taking elements.\n\nWait, but that might not directly work because after taking the min, we need to remove it, and then take the max of the remaining, and so on.

Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. For [1,2,3,4], the output is [1,4,2,3]. So the first element is the smallest, then the largest remaining, then the next smallest from what's left, and so on. So the process goes: min, max, min, max.\n\nSimilarly, for [5,5,5,5], it returns the same list because all elements are the same.\n\nAnother example is an empty list, which should return empty.\n\nSo the approach is to alternately pick the minimum and maximum from the remaining elements. But how do I handle this in code?\n\nMaybe I can use a two-pointer approach. Have one pointer starting at the beginning (minimum) and the other at the end (maximum).

Remaining list: [2,3,4]\n- Then take the largest of the remaining, which is 4. Now remaining list: [2,3]\n- Next, take the smallest of the remaining, which is 2.

Maybe we can model this as a two-step selection process.\n\nI think I can represent the sorted list as a sequence where we alternately pick min and max from the remaining elements.\n\nSo maybe the approach is to create a new list, and in each step, append the min or max based on the current step (even steps take min, odd steps take max).\n\nWait, but let's test this logic with the first example.\n\nSteps:\n- Initially, the list is [1,2,3,4].\n- Take min (1), append to result.

So the first element is the minimum, then the maximum of the remaining, then the next minimum, then the next maximum, and so on.

Hmm, right, so first, I have to think about how to process each element in the list.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For the first example, lst = [1,2,3], the output is 14. Let's see: 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 3 squared is 9. Adding those gives 14, but wait, each number was already an integer, so rounding didn't change them. Oh, but in another example, like [1.4, 4.2, 0], we need to round each to the nearest integer above, so 1.4 becomes 2, 4.2 becomes 5, 0 stays 0. Then their squares are 4, 25, 0 which sum to 29, matching the example.\n\nSo the steps are: for each number in the list, round it upwards. How to round upwards? In Python, the math.ceil function does that. But wait, if the number is already an integer, math.ceil returns the same integer. So that works for all cases.\n\nSo first, I'll need to import the math module to use ceil. But looking at the starter code, math isn't imported yet. So I'll have to add that in my function.\n\nWait, the function definition is given, so maybe I should include the import inside the function? Or better to import it outside. Well, in Python, functions have their own scope, so it's better to import math at the top of the module. But since the starter code doesn't have it, I'll have to include it in my solution.\n\nSo first, I'll loop through each element in the input list. For each element, apply math.ceil. Then, square it, and add it to a running total.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nImport math.\n\nDefine the function sum_squares which takes lst as an argument.\n\nInitialize a total to 0.\n\nLoop through each num in lst:\n\n   ceiling_num = math.ceil(num)\n\n   Add (ceiling_num)^2 to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes, that sounds right.\n\nWait, let's test with the first example.

That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: [1,4,9] gives 98. Well, again, since they are integers, their squares are just 1, 16, 81, which add up to 98.\n\nThe third example is [1,3,5,7]. Rounded, they're still integers. Squaring 1 is 1, 3 is 9, 5 is 25, 7 is 49. Sum is 1+9+25+49=84, which matches.\n\nNext, for [1.4,4.2,0]. So 1.4 is rounded up to 2, 4.2 to 5, 0 stays 0. Squares are 4, 25, 0. Sum is 4+25+0=29.\n\nAnd the last example is [-2.4,1,1]. When rounded up, -2.4 becomes -2, but wait, no. Ceiling of a negative number like -2.4 is the next lower integer, so it rounds to -2, right? Wait, let me think: ceiling of -2.4 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -2.4.

For lst = [1,2,3], each number is already an integer. Round each (which doesn't change them), square: 1, 4, 9. Sum is 14, which matches the sample output.\n2.

For every element, I have to round it up to the nearest integer. Once that's done, I square each of these rounded numbers and sum them all together.\n\nWait, so rounding each number to the ceiling means that if the number is already an integer, I leave it as is. For decimals, like 1.4, I round up to 2, right? And for negative numbers, I have to be careful. The ceiling function in Python rounds towards positive infinity.

Let's look at the first one: [1,2,3]. Each element is already an integer, so rounding to the upper int would just be themselves. So 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 3 squared is 9. Sum is 14, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: [1.4,4.2,0]. Rounding 1.4 to the upper int gives 2 because ceiling of 1.4 is 2. 4.2's ceiling is 5, and 0 stays 0. So squares are 4, 25, and 0. Sum is 29, which is correct.\n\nFor negative numbers like [-2.4,1,1], the ceiling of -2.4 is -2 because ceiling rounds up, so -2.4 is moved towards zero.

The sorting depends on whether the sum of the first index value and the last index value is odd or even.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the sorting condition correctly. The sum of the first and last index values decides how to sort. If the sum is odd, the array should be sorted in ascending order. If it's even, it should be sorted in descending order.\n\nFirst, let's note a few things:\n\n1. The function should not modify the original array. So I need to create a copy to work on.\n2. The array could be empty, in which case we just return an empty list.\n3. If the array has only one element, the sum would be the first index value (since there's only one element). But wait, in Python, when using negative indices, the last element of a single-element array is its only element. So for [5], the first index is 0, and the last is 0 (since array[-1] is 5). So sum is 0, which is even, but according to the example, sort_array([5]) should return [5]. Hmm, so maybe in the case of a single-element array, the sum is even (0) but it's not sorted, because maybe the condition is irrelevant when there's only one element.\n\nWait, looking at the examples:\n\n- sort_array([5]) returns [5], which is just the same array.\n\nSo, perhaps when the array has zero or one elements, we just return it as is, ignoring the sum condition.\n\nOkay, so first step: check if the array is empty.

The task is to sort the given array based on whether the sum of the first and last index values is odd or even. Hmm, right. So the condition is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the array. But wait, wait, the note says not to change the original array, which makes sense because we need to return a new sorted copy.\n\nSo let's break it down. The function needs to create a sorted version of the input array. The sorting depends on the sum of the first and last elements. But what if the array is empty? Like in the example, sort_array([]) returns an empty list. And if the array has only one element, the sum is that element itself, so if it's odd, we just return the same single element array.\n\nWait, but in Python, for an empty list, index 0 doesn't exist, so we need to handle that case first. For example, when the array is empty, return it as is.\n\nSo the first step in the function should be to check if the array is empty or has just one element. In those cases, return the array as is because anything can't be sorted or the condition doesn't apply.\n\nNext, for the cases where the array has at least two elements. The first thing is to determine the sum of the first and last elements. Let's see: first index is array[0], last index is array[-1], which is the same as array[len(array)-1].

For example, if the array is empty, I just return an empty array.

For each prime factor, you divide the number by it as many times as possible, adding the factor to the list each time.\n\nSo, the steps would be: start with an empty list to hold the factors. Check if the number is divisible by 2; if it is, divide it by 2 and add 2 to the list. Repeat this until it's no longer divisible by 2. Then move to the next possible primes: 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\nWait, how do I generate the primes? I don't need to generate all primes, just check each possible divisor starting from 2 upwards. So, for each i starting at 2, I check if i divides n. If it does, I divide n by i as many times as possible, adding i to the list each time. Continue this until i squared is greater than n. When that happens, if n is still greater than 1, it must be a prime factor itself, so I add it to the list.\n\nLet me outline this in code.\n\nInitialize an empty list called factors.\nStart with i = 2.\nWhile i * i <= n:\n   while n % i == 0:\n       add i to factors\n       divide n by i\n   increment i by 1\nAfter this loop, if n is greater than 1, add it to factors.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for 8:\ni starts at 2. 8 % 2 == 0, so divide by 2 three times, adding 2 each time. Then i becomes 3, but 3*3 is 9 > 8, so loop ends. n is now 1, so"], "idxs": [80], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [7.247376203536987]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Alright, I've got to write a Python function called factorize that takes an integer n and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to factorize a number, I can start dividing by the smallest possible primes and keep going until I can't anymore. So, starting from 2, then 3, then 5, etc. For each prime, I'll check how many times it divides n, and then add that many instances to the factors list.\n\nBut wait, I need to handle edge cases. What if n is less than 2? Oh right, because primes are greater than 1. So if n is 1 or 0, the function might need to handle that. But looking at the examples, it's just given for numbers like 8, 25, 70, which are all above 1. So perhaps the function should return an empty list for n less than 2, or maybe n should have some constraints as per the function's documentation.\n\nNext, the process.

Once 2 is done, move to the next prime number, which is 3.\n5. Repeat the process with 3.\n6. Continue this way, incrementing the prime by 2 each time (since even numbers can't be primes after 2).\n7. After checking all primes up to sqrt(n), if n is still greater than 1, it means it's a prime factor itself, so add it to the list.\n8. Finally, return the factors list.\n\nWait, but this might not cover very large n. Also, how do I efficiently get all the primes without checking every number?

The balance goes like this: 0 +1 =1, then +2=3, then -4= -1. At this point, the balance is -1 which is below zero, so we return True immediately. Even though the next operation is +5, we don't need to process it because we've already found that the balance was negative.\n\nSo, the steps for the function are:\n\n1. Initialize balance to 0.\n2. Loop through each operation in the operations list:\n   a. Add the operation to balance.\n   b. If balance is less than zero, return True.\n3. If the loop completes without returning True, return False.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Now, let's think about the edge cases. What if the first operation is - something? Like, below_zero([-5,1,2]). The balance after first operation is -5, so function returns True immediately.\n\nWhat if the operations list is empty?

The function should return True if it does, else False. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function is called below_zero and takes a List of integers called operations. The initial balance is zero. For each operation, I add it to the balance. I need to check after each addition if the balance is negative. If at any point it is, return True. If I go through all operations without the balance dipping below zero, return False.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Initialize a balance variable to 0.\n2.

If the loop finishes without balance dropping below zero, return False.\n\nWait, but in Python, is there a way to stop processing further operations once a negative balance is found? Yes, because as soon as we detect it, we return True, so the loop won't process any more elements.\n\nLet me think about the examples given.\n\nIn the first example: [1, 2, 3]. Starting at 0, adding 1 makes it 1, then 2 makes it 3, then 3 makes it 6. So balance is never negative, function returns False. That's correct.\n\nSecond example: [1, 2, -4, 5]. Starting at 0, add 1 (balance 1), add 2 (3), then -4. Now balance is -1, which is below zero. So we return True. The rest of the operations are processed if needed, but since we return immediately, it won't process the 5.\n\nAnother test case: what if balance is negative but then increases again. Like [ -3, 5 ]. After -3, balance is -3 (return True). It doesn't matter that later it's 5.\n\nWhat about a series where balance goes from positive to negative and back? For example: [5, -10, 3]. After 5, balance is 5. Then -10 makes it -5\u2014 immediately return True.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nInitialize balance as zero.

I should probably simulate each operation step by step and keep track of the current balance. For each number in the operations list, I add it to the balance if it's positive or subtract if it's negative. After each step, I check if the balance is negative. If it is, I immediately return True because that means the account fell below zero. If I go through all operations without the balance ever becoming negative, I return False.\n\nWait, but what about the initial state? The balance starts at zero, so before even processing the first operation, is the balance below zero? I think no, because it's zero, and the problem says \"at any point\", so the starting point is okay. So processing begins after that.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, initialize the balance to zero. Then, iterate through each operation in the list. For each operation, add it to the balance. Wait, no. Wait, the operations are a list of deposits and withdrawals. So, for example, 1 would add to the balance, -4 would subtract.

If after all operations, it never went below zero, return False.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. \n\nIn the first example: [1,2,3]. The balance steps are 0 +1=1, then +2=3, then +3=6.

The task is to determine if at any point the balance of a bank account drops below zero when performing a series of operations. The function should return True if this happens, False otherwise.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The account starts with a balance of zero. Each operation in the list is either a deposit or a withdrawal. Deposit operations are positive numbers, and withdrawals are negative, I suppose. Each operation is processed in sequence, and after each one, I need to check if the balance is below zero. If it is, the function returns True immediately. If it never goes below zero, it returns False after processing all operations.\n\nSo, the function is called 'below_zero' and takes a list of integers called 'operations'. It returns a boolean.\n\nHmm, looking at the examples:\n\nIn the first example, [1, 2, 3], each operation is a deposit, so the balance goes from 0 to 1, 2, 3. It never drops below zero, so it returns False.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 2, -4, 5], the balance starts at 0. After 1, it's 1. Then +2 to 3. Then -4, which brings it to -1.

For each operation, if it's a positive number, that's like depositing money, and if it's negative, that's withdrwing money.\n\nI need to track the balance after each operation. So, maybe I can initialize a balance variable at 0 and then loop through each operation, updating the balance by adding each number one by one. After each update, I check if the balance is below zero. If it is, I return True immediately.\n\nWait, right. Because I have to return True as soon as it goes below zero. Otherwise, if after all operations the balance is never negative, then I return False.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: below_zero([1, 2, 3]).\nInitially, balance is 0.\nAdd 1 \u2192 1.

Suppose the current balance is positive, and the next operation is a withdrawal (a negative number). So after applying the withdrawal, if the balance becomes negative, that's when we return True.

For each word, I need to count how many consonants it has. If that count equals n, then include the word in the result list. Also, the order should be the same as their occurrence in the original string.\n\nFirst, I need to know what's considered a consonant. In English, consonants are all letters except the vowels A, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y is considered a vowel, but the examples provided in the problem might give a clue. Let me check the examples.\n\nLooking at the given examples:\n\n- select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) returns [\"little\"]. Let's break this down.\n\"Mary\" has M, a (vowel), and r \u2014 so 2 consonants.

Then, if the count equals n, include that word in the result list.\n\nWhat's a consonant? Typically, consonants are all letters except vowels, which are usually a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y. Wait, in English, y is sometimes considered a vowel, but in this context, since the examples include \"lamb\" and \"Uncle\", where y isn't treated as a vowel, I think we need to define consonants as all letters except the vowels a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase.

Well, in English, consonants are all letters except for A, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y is considered a vowel, but according to the examples, in the first case, \"Mary\" has consonants M, R, Y. Wait, let me look at the examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at the first example: select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) returns [\"little\"]. So let's see, Mary has M, A( vowel), R, Y.

Let's check \"little\": L, I, T, T, L, E. So vowels are I and E. So the consonants are L, T, T, L. That's four consonants.

Then, collect those words and return them in the order they appear in the original string.\n\nHmm, what's a consonant? Well, in English, consonants are letters that are not vowels. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Sometimes Y is considered a vowel, but in this problem, I think we should treat Y as a consonant, but wait, looking at the examples might help clarify.\n\nLet's look at the examples given:\n\nIn the first example, select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) returns [\"little\"]. So let's check the word \"little\": it's spelled L-I-T-T-L-E. The consonants are L, T, T, L, which makes 4 consonants.

Because the function in the second example returns [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"] for n=3. So Mary has M, R, and Y, which is three consonants. So Y is being treated as a consonant here.\n\nSo, in this problem, Y is considered a consonant. So our definition of consonants should include all letters except A, E, I, O, U. So Y is consonant.\n\nAlright, that's clarified.\n\nNext, let's think about how to approach the problem.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Split the input string into words.

The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y, but in this case, based on the problem statement and examples, it seems y is not considered a vowel because in the example \"Uncle\" has 2 consonants: 'n' and 'c'. The word \"Uncle\" is U-n-cle, but wait: the 'U' is a vowel, but when counting consonants, it's the consonants in the word. So 'Uncle' has 'n' and 'c' as consonants. So 'Uncle' would have 2 consonants, but in the fifth example, select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) returns [\"Uncle\"], which is incorrect because 'Uncle' has 2 consonants. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check: the example shows that select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) returns [\"Uncle\"]. So the word \"Uncle\" must have exactly 3 consonants. Hmm, let's see: U-n-c-l-e. The letters are U, n, c, l, e. So consonants are n, c, l. That's three consonants. Oh right, because 'l' is a consonant. So I had to include 'l' as a consonant, so the count is 3. So 'Uncle' has 3 consonants.\n\nSo the function needs to count each letter in a word, excluding vowels, and if the count equals n, include the word in the result.\n\nSo, steps to do:\n\n1.

I can do this using the split() method, which splits on whitespace by default.\n\nWait, but the input string might have multiple spaces or other whitespace, but I think split() handles that by treating any whitespace as a separator and ignoring leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into words.

That makes sense because in the last example, \"Uncle\" has exact count 3 consonants, but 'Uncle' is U-n-c-l-e. So U is a vowel, so consonants are n, c, l. So three consonants.\n\nSo, for each word, I need to count the number of letters that are not vowels, i.e., not A, E, I, O, U, regardless of case?

Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what counts as a consonant. I recall that consonants are all letters except A, E, I, O, U, both uppercase and lowercase. Wait, but the input string can have both cases? Hmm, the examples show some words with uppercase and lowercase letters, like \"Mary\", so I think I should handle both cases.

So, the polynomial is like xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x\u00b2 + ...\n\nNow, the derivative of this polynomial. I remember that the derivative of a term like a*x^n is n*a*x^(n-1). So each term's coefficient in the derivative will be n times the original coefficient. Also, the degree of the polynomial decreases by one for each term except the constant term, which disappears because its derivative is zero.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\n1. The first term in the polynomial is xs[0], which is a constant. Its derivative is 0, so it won't appear in the derivative polynomial.\n\n2. The second term is xs[1]*x. The derivative of this is 1*xs[1]*x^(0) = xs[1]. So in the derivative, this term becomes xs[1], which is just a constant term.\n\nWait, no, wait. Hmm. Let me correct that. The second term is xs[1] multiplied by x, so when we take the derivative, it's 1* xs[1], and the x becomes x^0 or 1, so the coefficient is xs[1], but the term is now in the constant position.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the original polynomial, xs[0] is the constant term. So xs[1] is the coefficient for x. So the first term in the derivative will be the derivative of xs[1]*x, which is 1* xs[1]*x^0, but that's just xs[1], but in the derivative list, the coefficients start from x^0. Wait, no, let's index it correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the derivative as a new list where each element corresponds to the next power of x. So, for the derivative list, the first element corresponds to x^0, the second to x^1, etc. So, how do the original coefficients map to the derivative?\n\nLet me think with a concrete example.

The derivative of a polynomial is another polynomial where each term's coefficient is multiplied by its exponent. Then, the exponent is reduced by one.\n\nLet me remember the rules for differentiating polynomials. The derivative of a_n x^n is n * a_n x^(n-1). So for each term in the original polynomial, the derivative term is coefficient*degree multiplied by x^(degree-1). That means in the list, each element (except the first) will get multiplied by its index, and the index will be reduced by one.\n\nBut wait, how are the indices handled? For example, if the original list is [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the derivative should be [1,4,12,20].

So let's recall how to take the derivative of each term.\n\nThe derivative of a term like a_k x^k is k*a_k x^(k-1). So for each coefficient in the input list, I need to multiply it by its index (since the index represents the exponent). But wait, the index is zero-based, so the first term is x\u2070, which is a constant. The derivative of a constant is zero, so we can ignore the first term.\n\nSo for the list [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], let's loop through each term:\n\n1. The first term is 3x\u2070. Its derivative is 0. So we will skip it.\n2. The second term is 1x\u00b9. Its derivative is 1*1x\u2070 = 1.\n3. The third term is 2x\u00b2. Its derivative is 2*2x\u00b9 = 4.\n4. The fourth term is 4x\u00b3. Its derivative is 4*3x\u00b2 = 12.\n5. The fifth term is 5x\u2074. Its derivative is 5*4x\u00b3 = 20.\n\nSo the resulting coefficients would be [1, 4, 12, 20], as in the example. That makes sense.\n\nNow, thinking about the function. The function should process each coefficient starting from the first index (which corresponds to x\u2070, so we skip it) and for each, compute the new coefficient as (index)*xs[index], and collect these into a new list. But wait, in Python, lists are zero-based, so to get the coefficients for each term x^(n), we start from index 1 up to the end.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create an empty list to hold the new coefficients.\n2. Loop over each index and coefficient in the input list.\n3"], "idxs": [93], "new_tokens": [518], "wall_time": [8.252620458602905]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called derivative that takes a list of coefficients representing a polynomial and returns the derivative in the same form. Let's see, how do I approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the derivative of a polynomial term by term. So for each term in the polynomial, I'll compute its derivative and then collect those new terms into a new list.\n\nLet me think about the general form. Suppose the polynomial is p(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x\u00b2 + a3*x\u00b3 + ... + an*x\u207f. The derivative p\u2019(x) would be a1 + 2a2*x + 3a3*x\u00b2 + ... + nan*x\u207f\u207b\u00b9. So for each term after the first, the coefficient gets multiplied by its exponent, and the exponent decreases by one.\n\nWait, so in the input list, each index corresponds to the exponent. For example, the first element is a0 (x\u2070), the second is a1 (x\u00b9), and so on. So to find the derivative, I need to go through each coefficient starting from index 1 (since the derivative of a0 is zero, which we can ignore) and multiply each coefficient by its index.\n\nPutting this into code, let's see. I can loop from index 1 to the end of the list. For each index i, take the coefficient xs[i], multiply it by i, and add it to a new list.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]).\nProcessing:\n- i=0: coefficient is 3, but since i=0 is the constant term, its derivative is 0, so we skip.\n- i=1: 1 * 1 = 1\n- i=2: 2 * 2 = 4\n- i=3: 4 * 3 = 12\n- i=4: 5 * 4 = 20\nSo the new list is [1,4,12,20], which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: derivative([1,2,3])\nProcessing:\n- i=0: again, 0.\n- i=1: 2*1=2\n- i=2:3*2=6\nSo new list is [2,6], correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1.

Oh right, according to the examples given. So I can start by handling the empty list case.\n\nThen, for a non-empty list, I need to calculate the sum. That's straightforward, I can use the sum() built-in function or loop through the list adding each element.\n\nCalculating the product is a bit more involved. Since the product starts at 1, I can initialize a variable, say product = 1, and then loop through each number in the list, multiplying each number to product.\n\nWait, but what if there are zero in the list? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, and any subsequent numbers won't change that. But that's correct because zero is a valid integer and affects the product.\n\nLet me also think about the edge cases.

What about the case when the list is not empty but has no elements? No, because we already check if the list is empty.

If the list is empty, which can be checked with an if statement, I set the sum to 0. Otherwise, sum the numbers normally.\n\nNow, for the product. Multiplying all the integers. But wait, if the list is empty, we set the product to 1. That makes sense because the product of nothing is 1.

Oh right, I can use a loop and initialize a product variable at 1, then iterate through each number in the list, multiplying each one.\n\nWait, but what if the list contains zeros?

The product can be negative, but the function doesn't specify behavior for that. I think that's acceptable as per the problem statement.\n\nOkay, now let me code this.

So if I have something like sum(numbers) when the list is empty, it should return 0 without any issues. That's taken care of.\n\nBut wait, what about the product? For the product of an empty list, Python might throw an error if I just multiply all elements because if there's no elements, it might be trying to multiply by zero elements, leading to confusion. For example, the product should be 1 when the list is empty, right?\n\nSo how do I compute the product of all elements in the list, including the case where the list is empty? I remember that in Python, you can use a for loop with a product variable initialized to 1, then multiply each number in the list.

Let's break that down.\n\nFor the sum, it's straightforward. We can sum all the elements using the built-in sum() function. That should handle empty lists without issues because summing an empty list returns 0.\n\nNow, the product part is a bit trickier, especially when the list is empty. The product of no numbers is 1, as I mentioned. So, how do I compute the product?\n\nWell, I can initialize a product variable to 1. Then, iterate through each number in the list.

The product should correctly handle negative numbers as well because multiplication with negatives is standard.\n\nAlso, what if the list has only one number? Then, the sum is that number, and the product is the same number. That should work because the functions will just iterate once.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize sum_total to 0.\n2.

My task is to determine if I can concatenate them in some order (like first string then second or second then first) such that the resulting string has all balanced parentheses. If yes, I return 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So, the problem is about checking if the two strings can be ordered in a way that the combined string is valid. A valid string means all parentheses are properly opened and closed. So, for example, the string \"(()\" on its own has an imbalance, but if I can pair it correctly with another string, it might work.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the total number of opening and closing parentheses should be equal in a valid string. So if the list contains two strings, maybe I can count the total number of '(' and ')' after combining both strings. If the counts don't match (i.e., the total of '(' is not equal to the total of ')'), then it's automatically impossible. But this might not always catch all cases. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining the two strings in some order doesn't just depend on the total count but also on their arrangement. Even if the counts are equal, if the way they are arranged causes some imbalance during the traversal, it might not work.\n\nFor example, suppose one string is ')(' and the other is ')'. If I put the first string first, I get '))(, which doesn't make sense. But maybe ordering them differently would help. Wait, but actually, concatenating in any order is allowed, so I need to try both possibilities.\n\nBut how do I check each possibility? Maybe for each of the two possible orderings, concatenate the strings and then check if the resulting string is valid.\n\nBut how to check if a string is valid? I can write a function that tracks the balance as we go through the string. We'll maintain a counter that starts at 0. For each '(', we add 1, and for each ')', we subtract 1. If at any point the counter goes negative, it means there's an unmatched ')', so it's invalid. At the end, the counter must be zero to have all parentheses balanced.\n\nWait, yes. So that method makes sense. Let me outline the steps.\n\nThe function match_parens will take a list of two strings, lst.

My goal is to determine if concatenating these two strings in some order will result in a balanced parentheses string. The function should return 'Yes' if possible and 'No' otherwise.\n\nLet me think about the requirements. A balanced parentheses string means that every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing ')', and they are properly nested. For example, '()()' and '(())' are correct, but ')(' or '())' are not.\n\nThe function receives a list with two strings, say s1 and s2. I can choose the order in which to concatenate them. There are two possibilities: s1 + s2 or s2 + s1. I need to check both possibilities and see if either results in a balanced string.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Generate both possible concatenations: s1+s2 and s2+s1.\n2. For each concatenation, check if the combined string is valid.\n3. If either is valid, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.\n\nNow, the key part is the function to check if a string is balanced. How can I implement this?\n\nOne common approach is to use a stack. As I iterate through each character in the string:\n- If I encounter '(', push it onto the stack.\n- If I encounter ')', check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is unbalanced. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.\nAt the end, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all parentheses are balanced.\n\nLet me outline this:\n\ndef is_balanced(s):\n    stack = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        else:\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- I'll create a helper function is_balanced that takes a string and returns True if balanced, else False.\n- In match_parens, I'll generate both permutations of the two input strings.\n- For each permutation, I'll check using is_balanced.\n- If any permutation is balanced, return 'Yes'.

A balanced string means every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and each pair is properly nested. For instance, '(()') is balanced, but '())' is not because there's an extra closing parenthesis that doesn't match.\n\nSo the function takes a list of two strings, say lst, and I have to check if any permutation of concatenating these two strings results in a balanced string. The strings can be concatenated in either order: first string of lst followed by the second, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, let me think about the approach here. One idea is to check both possible concatenations (lst[0]+lst[1] and lst[1]+lst[0]) and see if either of these results in a correctly balanced string. \n\nBut how do I check if a string is balanced? The standard approach is to use a stack. I'll iterate through each character, pushing '(' onto the stack and popping when I encounter a ')', keeping track of the stack's depth. If at any point the stack is empty when a ')' is encountered, or if the end of the string has a non-zero stack, the string is unbalanced.\n\nWait, right.

Concatenate the first string followed by the second (s1 + s2)\n   b. Concatenate the second string followed by the first (s2 + s1)\n\n2. For each concatenated string, check if it's balanced:\n   a. Iterate through each character, keeping a stack (or a counter).\n   b. For each '(', push it onto the stack.\n   c. For each ')', if there's a corresponding '(' in the stack, pop it. Otherwise, return False for this string.\n   d. After processing all characters, if there are no elements left in the stack, it's balanced.\n\n3. If either of the two concatenated strings is balanced, return 'Yes'; else, return 'No'.\n\nWait, but what about the case where one string is the empty string?

My task is to determine if it's possible to concatenate these two strings in some order (either string first or the other first) such that the resulting string is balanced. If it is possible, I return 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.\n\nLet me understand the problem better. A balanced string means that for every opening parenthesis '(', there's a corresponding closing one ')', and at no point do the closing parentheses exceed the opening ones when read from left to right. So, the string must be valid at all points, not just at the end.\n\nThe examples given are helpful. For instance, the first example ['()(', ')'] returns 'Yes'. Let's see why: maybe when we arrange the strings, like putting the second string first and the first string after, but wait, no. Wait, the first string is '()(', which is actually a bit tricky\u2014since concatenating that would have an uneven number. Wait, let me think. Let's break it down.\n\nWait, no: the function takes a list of two strings. So the two strings are s1 and s2. We can choose the order as s1 + s2 or s2 + s1. So, for the first example, ['()(', ')'], s1 is '()(', which is length 3, '(', ')', '('. Then s2 is ')', a single ')'.\n\nSo, let's try both orders:\n\nCase 1: Combine s1 and s2: '()(' + ')' \u2192 '()()', which is '(() )\u2014Wait, no: '()(' is '(', ')', '(', then adding ')' makes it '()()', which is valid? Wait, wait. Wait, '()(' is '(', ')', '(', so when I add a ')', it becomes '()()', which is actually two closing and two opening parentheses in total. Let me think: does '()()' have balanced parentheses? Let's see:\n\n- The first '(' has a matching ')', so after the first two characters, it's balanced. Then another '(' is added but then a ')', so the total is balanced. So yes, it's valid.\n\nBut wait, '()(' is already a string. So s1 is '()(', s2 is ')'. When you combine s1 and s2 as s1 + s2, you get '()()'\u2014is that right?\n\nWait, s1 is '"], "idxs": [136], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [11.77468991279602]}, {"index": 4, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I'm given a list of two strings, each consisting of only '(' and ')'. My task is to determine if there's a way to concatenate them in some order so that the resulting string is balanced, meaning all parentheses are properly opened and closed.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string is balanced if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. So, the key here is the order of concatenation and ensuring the overall count and order are correct.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The two strings can be arranged in two orders: string1 first, then string2, or string2 first, then string1. I need to check both possibilities and see if either results in a balanced string.\n\nWhat's a balanced condition? It requires that the total number of '(' equals the total number of ')'. Otherwise, it's immediately impossible. So, before doing any further checks, I should compute the total count of each parenthesis in both strings and see if their combined counts are equal.\n\nWait, that's right. So, for the concatenated result, the total '(' and ')' counts must be the same. So the first step is to get the counts of '(' and ')' from both strings combined, in both possible orders, and see if any of them sum equally.\n\nBut actually, since the two strings are fixed in their content, the sum of all '(' from both and all ')' from both must be the same. So I need to check whether the total number of '(' is equal to the total number of ')'. If not, then it's impossible regardless of the order, so I can return 'No'.\n\nBut if the counts are equal, then even that is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The order also matters. For example, if you have a string starting with more ')', that could be a problem.\n\nSo the steps should be:\n\n1. Check if the total number of '(' equals the total of ')'. If not, return 'No'.\n2. Otherwise, for both possible orders of concatenation, check if the resulting string is balanced.\n3. If either concatenation results in a balanced string, return 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nSo now, how to check if a concatenated string is balanced.\n\nOption 1: For each order (s1 + s2 and s2 + s1), simulate the process of checking balanced parentheses.\n\nWhen checking a string for being balanced, we can keep track of the balance.

So I can generate both strings and check each for validity.\n\nBut how to check if a string is valid? I think using a stack approach would work. I'll go through each character and push '(' onto the stack, and pop when a ')' is encountered, but only if the stack isn't empty. If at any point a ')' is found with an empty stack, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, I can also track the balance: for each '(', add 1, for each ')', subtract 1. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it's invalid. At the end, the balance should be zero.\n\nRight, that's a common approach. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Combine the two strings in both possible orders, so 2 cases to consider.\n2. For each case, check if the combined string is balanced.\n3. If either is balanced, return 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nSo first, I need to write a helper function to check if a string is balanced. Let's call it is_balanced(s). \n\nAlternatively, I can implement the check directly within the main function without a helper.\n\nLet me sketch the helper function:\n\ndef is_balanced(s):\n    balance = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '(':\n            balance +=1\n        else:\n            balance -=1\n        if balance <0: # cannot have more ')' than '(' at any point\n            return False\n    return balance ==0\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo in the main function, I will create s1 = lst[0] + lst[1] and s2 = lst[1] + lst[0], then check if either is_balanced(s1) or"], "idxs": [112], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [10.511534214019775]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I'm given a list of two strings, each containing only parentheses.

I have to check both possible orders of concatenation: order 1 is first string and then second, order 2 is second then first.\n\nWhat makes a string balanced? A balanced string has every opening parenthesis matched with a closing one, and at no point do the closing parentheses exceed the opening ones when scanned from left to right. So, for example, if the concatenation ever has more closing parentheses than opening, it's not balanced.\n\nHmm, maybe I can count the number of opening and closing parentheses in each string and see how they can combine. Let's denote the first string as s1 and the second as s2.\n\nWait, but it's not just about the counts; the order matters. For example, if s1 has more closing parentheses than opening, that's bad, but perhaps s2 can balance that.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to simulate the process for both orders and see if either of them results in a balanced string.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For both possible orders (s1 followed by s2, and s2 followed by s1), simulate the concatenation process to check if it's balanced.\n2. For each order, keep track of the balance as we go through each character. The balance increases by 1 for each '(', decreases by 1 for each ')', and must never drop below zero. Also, the total balance must be zero at the end for the string to be balanced.\n3. If either order results in a balanced string, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'.\n\nSo, I'll need a helper function that takes a string and returns whether it's balanced. Alternatively, I can handle the simulation within the main function.\n\nLet me plan the helper function. The function will iterate through each character in the concatenated string and maintain a balance. For each '(', balance increases, for ')', it decreases. The helper should return True if the balance never drops below zero and ends at zero; else, False.\n\nWait, but for the helper, I don't need to"], "idxs": [112], "new_tokens": [517], "wall_time": [10.781259775161743]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I have to solve this problem where I'm given two strings composed of only '(' and ')', and I need to determine if I can concatenate them in some order to form a balanced string.

A balanced string has every opening parenthesis '(' matched with a closing one ')', and vice versa. The key is that at any point in the string, the number of closing parentheses can't exceed the number of opening ones. Also, by the end, the total number of '(' and ')' must be equal.\n\nSince I have two strings to concatenate, I can choose the order: either string A first and then string B, or string B first and then string A. So my approach should be to check both possibilities and see if either results in a balanced string.\n\nWait, but I'm given a list with two strings, not necessarily in any particular order. Oh, no, wait, the function's parameter is called lst. So in the sample inputs, they are given as ['()(', ')'], which I think means the two strings are '()(' and ')'.

Instead of generating all possible permutations, since there are only two strings, it's manageable.

I remember that for a string to be balanced, every opening parenthesis must have a corresponding closing one in the correct order. So, for example, something like '(()' isn't balanced because there are more opens than closes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible permutations of the two strings. Since there are two strings, each with their own length, the number of ways to permute them is 2! = 2 possibilities: either the first string comes first and then the second, or vice versa. So I'll need to check both concatenations.\n\nWait, but each string is a set of characters. So for each permutation, I combine the two strings and then check if the result is balanced.\n\nBut checking if a string is balanced can be done using a stack, I think. The standard approach is to iterate through each character, pushing onto the stack for '(' and popping from it for ')', making sure the stack never becomes empty and ends empty. So for the concatenated string in each permutation, I can apply this check.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way without doing work twice. Let's think about the counts. For each permutation, let's denote:\n\n- The first string is S1, the second is S2.\n\nIn permutation 1: S1 + S2\nIn permutation 2: S2 + S1\n\nSo for each case, I need to check if the combined string is balanced.\n\nBut what if I don't just check each permutation's count, but also their combined individual counts.

For example, '(()' has two '(', one ')', which has a count imbalance, but '())' also has imbalance as well.\n\nWait, no. Wait, '()' is balanced, '())' is not. So just having an equal number of '(' and ')' doesn't guarantee a balanced string, but it is a necessary condition.

So the number is -12, which is a negative number. But when we talk about digits, the negative sign isn't a digit, right? So the digits here are 1 and 2. Since 2 is even and 1 is odd, that's one even and one odd, which matches the tuple.\n\nThe second example is even_odd_count(123) returning (1, 2). So 123 has digits 1, 2, 3. 2 is even, and 1 and 3 are odd.

Well, perhaps I can convert the number to a string, ignore the negative sign if present, and then iterate through each character, converting each to an integer to check if it's even or odd.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\n- Take num as input.\n- Convert num to a string, then get each character, absolute value of the number to avoid negative sign interference.\n- For each digit in this string:\n   - Convert it to an integer.\n   - Check if it's even or odd.\n- Update the counts accordingly.\n\nBut wait, what about zero?

Because negative numbers have a minus sign, which isn't a digit, so I should make sure to ignore that. Wait, right, so for example, if the input is -12, the digits are 1 and 2. So, converting it to a string would give \"-12\", and I can just process each character after the first one.\n\nSo step one: convert the input num to a string. Then, loop through each character in that string. Skip the first character if it's a '-' because that's not a digit.\n\nWait, but what about zero? Well, zero is even, so that should be counted correctly.\n\nOnce I have each digit as a character, I can convert it to an integer. Then, check if it's even or odd. How to do that? I can use the modulus operator: if digit % 2 == 0, then even, else odd.\n\nI'll need two counters: one for even digits and one for odd.

The digits are 1, 2 in absolute value. Wait, but 1 is odd and 2 is even. So even count is 1 and odd count is 1. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example, even_odd_count(123) returns (1,2). Digits are 1, 2, 3. Even digits are just 2, so count is 1. Odd digits are 1 and 3, so count is 2.\n\nSo, the function should process each digit of the number, ignoring the sign, I think.

One way is to convert the number into a string, then iterate through each character, convert each back to an integer.

So, actually, when the number is negative, we don't consider the minus sign, just the digits.

Odd digits: 1 and 3, count 2.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert the given number into its absolute value to ignore the negative sign.\n2.

The digits here are 1,2,3. So even is 2, only one even. And then 1 and 3 are odd, so two odds.

I remember that to find the closest pair, one common method is to compute the difference between every pair of numbers and then find the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nSo, maybe I can loop through each pair in the list and calculate their differences. But that sounds like it's O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for small lists, but I'm not sure if the problem expects a more efficient algorithm. But for now, since the examples don't have very large inputs, a double loop might work.\n\nWait, how do I loop through each pair efficiently? Oh right, I can use combinations from itertools. So I can import itertools and then for each combination of two numbers, compute the absolute difference.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the sorted() function can help me if I need the numbers in order at the end. Maybe I should sort the list first. If I sort the list, then the closest numbers are likely to be adjacent in the sorted list, but not always.

Return that pair as a tuple, ordered from smaller to larger.\n\nWait, but after sorting, the differences are only between consecutive elements. But is that enough? Could there be a pair that's not consecutive in the sorted list that has a smaller difference? Hmm, for example, in the sample input [1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.2], when sorted, it becomes [1.0,2.0,2.2,3.0,4.0,5.0]. The closest pair is 2.0 and 2.2, which are consecutive.

The examples show that if there are duplicates, like two 2.0s, that's the closest, right? So my function should handle that.\n\nHow do I find the closest pair? Well, one way is to calculate the difference between every pair of numbers and track which pair has the smallest difference.

But for the problem, maybe it's acceptable, especially since the user didn't specify any constraints on the list size.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list. If I sort the list first, the closest elements are likely to be next to each other. This reduces the number of comparisons I need to make because I can just look at adjacent elements.\n\n2.

Maybe for each i, pair it with j where j > i.\n\nWait, no. Because even if j is before i, the difference is the same. So, to avoid checking each pair twice, I should loop with i from 0 to n-2, and for each i, loop j from i+1 to n-1.\n\nThat way, I check each unique pair once. This should save some computation time, though for small lists, it's negligible.\n\nSo,"], "idxs": [92], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [8.259055614471436]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the two closest elements in a list of numbers and return them as a tuple. The list is of floats and has at least two elements. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. The function needs to take a list of floats and return a tuple where the first element is the smaller of the two closest numbers and the second is the larger. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2.2], the closest numbers are 2.0 and 2.2, so the function returns (2.0, 2.2). Another example is [1,2,3,4,5,2], which returns (2,2) because both 2s are the closest.\n\nSo, how do I find the closest pair? One way is to compute the difference between every pair of numbers and then find the pair with the smallest difference. But that might be inefficient if the list is large because it's O(n^2) time. However, since the problem doesn't mention constraints on the list size, this approach might be acceptable. For learning purposes, I'll proceed with this method.\n\nWait, maybe there's a more efficient way. I remember that if you sort the list first, the closest elements will be adjacent in the sorted list. That makes sense because the closest numbers would be next to each other once sorted. So, that reduces the problem to finding the minimal difference between consecutive elements.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Compute the differences between each consecutive pair.\n3. Find the smallest difference.\n4. Return the pair that has this difference. If the difference is zero, meaning there are duplicates of the closest number, return both as a tuple.\n\nBut wait, what about duplicates? For example, if the list has two 2s, how do we handle that? Let's see in the sample where [1,2,3,4,5,2] returns (2,2). So in the unsorted list, if 2 appears once, and in the sorted list it's at position 1, then the next pair would be 2 and maybe 2 again, but in the example, the list didn't have another 2.

The function is supposed to return them as a tuple, with the smaller number first and the larger second. Also, if there are duplicates, it should handle that by pairing the same number together if that's the closest pair.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this. One way is to sort the list because that way, the closest numbers will be next to each other. Once sorted, I can compare each consecutive pair to see which has the smallest difference.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple pairs with the same smallest difference? For example, if the list is [1, 3, 5, 7], all differences are 2, so any adjacent pair is the closest. But if the list is [1, 2, 4, 8, 10], the closest is 4 and 8 at a difference of 4. But if I have a list like [1, 2, 2, 3], then the two 2s are the closest, and I should return (2,2).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the list to bring the closest elements together.\n2.

Then, even if a larger difference comes after, it won't affect the result.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use a set to track the elements and their closest neighbors. But since the list could have duplicates and multiple occurrences, that might complicate things.\n\nLet me try the first approach of sorting. So, first, I'll sort the input list. Then, I'll loop from the first to the second last element, comparing each element with the next one.\n\nI'll need variables to track the current smallest difference and the pair of numbers that caused this difference. Also, I need to handle the case where the smallest difference is the same as a previously found difference and determine which pair to keep.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the list.\n- Initialize variables: closest_pair as the first two elements, min_diff as the difference between them.\n- Loop from i"], "idxs": [101], "new_tokens": [517], "wall_time": [8.868491888046265]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the two closest elements in a list of numbers.

I have a list of floats, and I need to find the pair that's closest to each other. Then return them in order as a tuple. \n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, one idea is to compute the differences between every pair of numbers and find the pair with the smallest difference. That makes sense, but if the list is long, say N elements, that's O(N^2) time. But given that the examples are small, maybe it's acceptable for the problem's constraints.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple pairs with the same minimal difference? For example, in the second test case, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], the closest pair is (2.0,2.0) because they are the same. So I need to handle that.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1.

So the function returns the same numbers as the pair.\n\nNow, how to compute all pairs. I think using itertools.combinations would be efficient as it generates all unique pairs without repetition.\n\nSo, using itertools, I can create a list of tuples, each representing a pair, and then compute the differences.\n\nBut the function is supposed to return the pair as a tuple (smaller, larger). So for each pair (a, b), I should ensure that if a > b, I swap them so that the tuple is in order.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort each pair before comparing.

So, in l', the values at the even indices are the same as in l but sorted.

For the original list, the even indices are index 1 and 3? Wait, but the list has length 3, so indices are 0,1,2. So even indices are 0 and 2? Or maybe the problem is using 0-based or 1-based indexing. Because in the example given, [1,2,3], the output is the same. So let's think: in the output, the odd indices (probably 1-based) are the same as the original. Wait, no. Wait, in the note, the sample shows that for [5,6,3,4], the output is [3,6,5,4].

Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, first, I should understand what the indices are considered. In Python, list indices start at 0. So, the even indices would be 0, 2, 4, etc., since those are the even-numbered positions when counting from zero. Wait, but in the example provided, for [5,6,3,4], the output is [3,6,5,4]. Let me look at that.\n\nIn the original list [5,6,3,4], the even indices are 0 and 2. The values at those positions are 5 and 3. So, the task is to sort the elements at these even indices.

Then, create a new list where the elements at even indices are replaced by the sorted elements, while the elements at odd indices remain as they were.\n\nSo, let's plan how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I can iterate through the list and collect the elements at even indices. How? I can loop through each index and check if it's even. Alternatively, use list comprehension.\n\nFor example:\nevens = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i % 2 =="], "idxs": [90], "new_tokens": [520], "wall_time": [8.048851251602173]}, {"index": 3, "turns": ["Okay, I have to complete this Python function called sort_even.

The usual approach is to use a stack data structure. The idea is to push each opening bracket onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, we pop from the stack and check if it matches the top of the stack. If it doesn't match, the string is invalid. Also, if all opening brackets are properly closed, the stack should be empty at the end.\n\nSo, translating that to this problem: any '<' would push onto the stack, and '>' would require that the top of the stack is a '<'. Also, if there's a '>' when the stack is empty or the top isn't '<', then it's invalid.\n\nWait, the problem says that \"every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\" Does that mean that the total number of '<' and '>' must be equal? For example, the string \"<>\" has one of each, so it's valid. But what about a string like \"<<<>\"? That has three opening and one closing, which isn't balanced.\n\nSo, the stack approach should cover that because each '>' will check against the top of the stack, ensuring that each closing matches an opening correctly.

For each character, if it's an opening bracket '<', I push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket '>', I check if the stack is not empty. If the stack isn't empty, I pop the top element.

Oh right, numbers with one or two digits are included, but numbers with three or more digits are excluded.\n\nLet me look at the example they provided to better understand. The input is arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and k = 4. The output is 24, which is the sum of 21 and 3. Wait, why isn't 111 included? Oh, because 111 has three digits.

There are a few ways to do this:\n\nOne way is to convert the number to a string and check its length. If len(str(number)) <= 2, then it's included.\n\nAnother way is to use mathematical operations.

So, the task is to look at the first k elements of arr, then within those, sum the elements that are two-digit numbers or less. Wait, wait, no\u2014the function's description says \"at most two digits,\" so numbers with 1 or 2 digits. For example, 3 is one digit, so it's included, 21 is two digits, so included, but 4000 is four digits, so it's not.\n\nSo, for the example given, the array is [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and k is 4. So the first four elements are 111, 21, 3, 4000.

So something like arr[:k] gives me the first k elements.\n\nNext, for each element in arr[:k], I need to check if it has at most two digits. How can I do that? Well, converting each number to a string and then checking the length of the string would work. Because numbers like 3 become \"3\", giving length 1, and 21 becomes \"21\", length 2. 4000 is \"4000\", length 4, which is more than 2, so exclude.\n\nAlternatively, I can use mathematical operations.

The example input is arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and k = 4. The output is 24, which is the sum of 21 and 3. So, what's happening here? Let's break it down.\n\nThe function is supposed to consider the first k elements of the array. In this case, k is 4, so the first four elements are 111, 21, 3, and 4000. Now, from these four, we need to sum the elements that have at most two digits. Hmm, wait\u2014how do we define \"at most two digits\"? I think that means numbers with 1 or 2 digits. So, numbers less than 10 have one digit, those between 10 and 99 have two digits. \n\nLooking at the first four elements: 111 is a three-digit number, 21 is two digits, 3 is one digit, and 4000 is four digits.

Otherwise, skip it.\n\nNow, how do I check if a number has at most two digits? One way is to use the logarithm. For a number n, if log10(n) is less than 2, then it has one digit (since log10(9) is approximately 0.95). Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Let me think again. Actually, numbers from 0 to 9 have one digit, 10 to 99 have two digits. So, any number that's less than 100 is okay. Because 100 is three digits.

Well, the first four elements of the array are 111, 21, 3, 4000. But wait, arr in this example, k=4, so it's the first four elements. Now, we need to consider each of those four and check if they have at most two digits.\n\nLet's break it down. \n\n- 111: that's three digits. So it's more than two digits, so it's not included.\n- 21: two digits, so included.\n- 3: that's a single digit, so included.\n- 4000: four digits, so way more than two.

Then, for each next level, I have to determine whether the next number is odd or even based on the previous level's position.\n\nWait, actually, let me read the problem statement again. It says, the next level's stones are determined by whether the current n is odd or even. Or is it the level's index? Hmm, the function says that each element in the list at index i represents the number of stones in level (i+1). So, the first element is level 1 with n stones, the second is level 2, and so on.\n\nWait, no. The examples clarify this. For n=3, the output is [3,5,7], which has three elements. So level 1 has 3 stones, level 2 5, level 3 7. So the next level's stone count depends on the current level number, whether it's odd or even.\n\nSo, the way the problem is phrased: The next level's stones are determined by whether the current n is odd or even. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: The number of stones in the next level is the next odd if n is odd, or next even if n is even. Wait, wait, no\u2014actually, the problem says for the next level, which is the next level after the current one. So, if the current level's n is odd, the next level's number is the next odd number. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on whether the level number is odd or even? No, maybe the initial level is n stones. Then, each subsequent level is determined by whether the current level's number is odd or even.\n\nWait, the problem says: the next level is the next odd if n is odd, but that seems confusing because n is the initial number,"], "idxs": [97], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [8.596264839172363]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_a_pile that takes an integer n and returns a list of stones for each level.

Let me think: the first coefficient is xs[0], which is multiplied by x^0, which is 1. Then xs[1] is multiplied by x^1, which is x. Then xs[2] by x\u00b2, and so on. So, the exponents are the index i.\n\nBut the way it's written, the list comprehension is [coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)]. Hmm, enumerate gives (i, coeff) as (0, xs[0]), (1, xs[1]), etc. So for each i, which is the exponent, we take the coefficient and multiply by x^i. So the first term is xs[0] * x^0, which is 1. Wait, so that actually matches the polynomial correctly. So in the example where xs is [1,2], it's 1 + 2x, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example for find_zero([1,2]), it says it returns -0.5. So the function poly with x=-0.5 should be zero. Let me compute 1 + 2*(-0.5) = 1 -1 = 0. Correct. So the poly function seems to be correct.\n\nBut is there any issue?

The poly function takes the coefficients and a point x and returns the polynomial evaluated at x. The find_zero function wants to find an x such that poly(x, xs) is zero. So essentially, it's solving the equation f(x) = 0 for x, where f is the polynomial.\n\nNow, think about the tests. The first test is find_zero([1, 2]). The polynomial is 1 + 2x.

The function is annotated to return a float, so as long as the calculations result in a float, it's fine.\n\nAlso, considering that the numbers are in a list, perhaps a list of floats, but they could be integers as well. Subtracting and taking absolute values should handle both cases.\n\nPutting it all together, the function should:\n\n1. Calculate the mean.\n2. Compute the absolute differences between each number and the mean.\n3. Sum those differences.\n4. Divide by the number of numbers.\n5.

To get the mean, I need to sum all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Right, so sum(numbers) divided by len(numbers).\n\nOnce I have the mean, I'll need to calculate the absolute difference between each number and this mean. Oh, wait, so for each number in the list, I do number - mean, take the absolute value, and then sum all those differences.\n\nBut wait, since I'm calculating the mean again for each number, maybe I should first calculate the mean once and store it in a variable.

The docstring explains what MAD is and gives an example. I need to implement the function correctly.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the mean of the list. The mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the number of elements.

I can loop through each number in the list, calculate the difference, take the absolute value, and keep a total of these values.

The basic ones are I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). Also, there are subtractive combinations like IV (4) and IX (9). But I also need to handle numbers like 400 as CD and 900 as CM.\n\nSo, I think I should create a mapping of the integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.

The main symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which correspond to 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 respectively.\n\nI think the best approach is to create two lists: one for the basic values and their corresponding Roman characters, and another that includes the special cases for when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, which indicates subtraction (like IV for 4 or IX for 9).\n\nSo, I'll start by creating a list of tuples. Wait, but for the subtractive notation, maybe it's better to handle them separately. For example, 4 is written as IV, which is 1 subtracted from 5. So, I can have my values in descending order so that when I iterate, I can check if the current number is larger than the next, leading to subtraction.\n\nHmm, perhaps the standard way is to use a list that includes both the subtractive and additive values. Let me think: for numbers up to 1000, the main values are M, CM, CD, D, CC, C, XC, X, L, XL, X, IX, I.\n\nWait, that's a way where we group the subtractive combinations first. So for 900, it's CM; for 400, CD; 50 is L, but 40 is XL, right? Wait, no, wait: in the standard Roman numerals, 900 is CM (900 = 1000 - 100), 400 is CD, 90 is XC, 40 is XL, 9 is IX, 4 is IV.

To convert a number to Roman numerals, I think the standard approach is to use a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman character. These tuples are usually ordered from largest to smallest so that we can subtract the largest possible values first.\n\nFor example, the tuple list might look like this: [(100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')]. This way, starting from the largest value, we check how many times the value fits into the number. For each fit, we append the corresponding Roman character to the result string and subtract the value from the number.\n\nWait, but in the examples given, for 19, it's 'xix', which is X IX, which is 10 + 9 = 19. So the function seems to handle subtractive notation correctly. That means my approach should account for subtracting when possible.\n\nSo, I'll start by initializing an empty string to build the Roman numeral. Then, I'll loop through each of the tuples in the list. For each tuple, I'll check how many times the value fits into the current number. For each fit, I'll append the character that many times to the string. Then, subtract the total of those fits from the original number and move on to the next smaller value.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, create the list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from largest to smallest. Then, for each pair:\n\n- While the current number is greater than or equal to the value:\n   - Append the symbol to the result string.\n   - Subtract the value from the number.\n\nThis should handle cases where multiple symbols are needed, like 400 is 'MMM', but also cases where subtractive combinations are used, like 4 is 'IV' instead of IIII.\n\nI think that should work.

The basic symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, M. Each of these represents specific numbers: I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L is 50, C is 100, D is 500, and M is 1000.\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out the correct way to break down the number into these symbols. There's a subtractive notation where certain letters are placed before others to make the numeral smaller. For example, IV is 4, IX is 9, XL is 40, etc. But in later parts of the Roman numeral system, subtractive notation changes. Like, after 400, you subtract, but before that, it's different. Since the restriction is that the number is between 1 and 1000, I need to consider that M is included.\n\nSo, to convert a number to Roman numerals, I can think of breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. Then, I can map each part to the corresponding Roman symbols.\n\nWait, but the process is a bit more involved. For each digit in each place, I need to decide which symbols to use. Let me think about the possible digits and how they are represented.\n\nLet's outline the possible values and their Roman equivalents:\n\n- 0 (in thousands place) is represented by nothing.\n- 1,000 is M.\n- 0 (hundreds but part of a higher digit, like 1000 requires M for the thousands place, but hundreds might be present as C, CC, etc.)\n- For hundreds: \n  - 0 -> nothing\n  - 1 -> C\n  - 2 -> CC\n  - 3 -> CCC\n  - 4 -> CD\n  - 5 -> D\n  - 6 -> DC\n  - 7 -> DCC\n  - 8 -> DCCC\n  - 9 -> CM\n\nWait, but no, that's not"], "idxs": [114], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [9.805933475494385]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called int_to_mini_roman that converts a given integer into its Roman numeral equivalent as a lowercase string. The function should handle numbers from 1 to 1000.\n\nFirst, I remember that Roman numerals are built using specific letters, each of which represents certain values. I think the usual Roman numerals go up to 3999, but since we're limited to 1000, maybe we can use the same mappings up to 1000.\n\nSo, I should create a mapping of the values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols. I think the common ones are:\nI = 1\nV = 5\nX = 10\nL = 50\nC = 100\nD = 500\nM = 1000\n\nI'll create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the integer value and the corresponding Roman character. For example, (1, 'I'), (5, 'V'), and so on.\n\nWait, but since the maximum is 1000, which is M, the list should go up to M. So the list would include all values up to 1000.\n\nNow, how do I convert the given number into Roman numerals? The usual approach is to subtract the largest possible value from the number, append the corresponding character to the result string, and then proceed with the remainder.\n\nFor example, if the number is 19, I would first subtract 10 (X), making the remainder 9. Then subtract 5 (V), remain 4. Then subtract 1 (I), remain 0. So the Roman numeral is XIX.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Create a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from largest to smallest.\n2. Initialize an empty result string.\n3. Iterate over each pair:\n   a. While the number is greater or equal to the value, append the symbol to the result string and subtract the value from the number.\n4. Return the result string.\n\nWait, but what about the order of the list? It needs to go from largest to smallest, so I should sort the list in descending order.\n\nSo, the mapping list should be sorted in descending order. Let's see:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),"], "idxs": [99], "new_tokens": [521], "wall_time": [8.730969190597534]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called int_to_mini_roman that converts a given number into its Roman numeral equivalent. The input is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and the output should be a string in lowercase. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Roman numerals have specific symbols and their values. The commonly used ones are I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). Also, sometimes subtraction is used, like IV for 4 or IX for 9.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any subtractive notation. Let me look back at the examples. For 19, the output is 'xix', which is XIX. So no subtractive notation here. Similarly, 152 is 'clii', which is CLII. And 426 is 'cdxxvi', which is CDXXVI. So the output seems to use the standard subtractive values for 4 and 9, like CD for 400, CM for 900, etc.\n\nSo, my function should handle numbers up to 3999 usually, but given the restriction is 1 to 1000, I don't need to worry about numbers beyond M (1000). But since 1000 is allowed, I should include M in the possible symbols.\n\nAlright, so I need to create a mapping of the Roman numeral values to their string representations. Let me list out the values and their corresponding Roman numerals for numbers up to 1000.\n\nThe standard mapping would be:\n\n1000: 'M'\n\n900: 'CM'\n\n500: 'D'\n\n400: 'CD'\n\n100: 'C'\n\n90: 'XC'\n\n50: 'L'\n\n40: 'XL'\n\n10: 'X'\n\n9: 'IX'\n\n5: 'V'\n\n4: 'IV'\n\n1: 'I'\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo I can create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman symbol. Then, I can iterate through this list in descending order, subtracting the largest possible value from the number each time and building the result string.\n\nWait, but for numbers like 426, which is 400 + 20 + 6, the 400 is 'CD', 20 is XX (XX), but wait, wait, 20 is XX, but looking at the example, 426 becomes CDXXVI.

The examples show that numbers like 19 become 'xix' and 152 becomes 'clii'. So, I think the function needs to handle numbers up to 3999, but according to the problem statement, it's restricted to 1 to 1000.\n\nHmm, I remember Roman numerals are made by combining symbols and adding their values. Each symbol represents a specific value, like I=1, V=5, X=10, etc. And sometimes, when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it's subtracted, like IV for 4 or IX for 9.\n\nSo, I should think about how to break down the given number into these values in a way that the output string represents the correct Roman numeral, but in a specific format for the mini roman. I'm not sure if the 'mini' part means using only certain symbols or a specific style, but looking at the examples, it seems like it's just the standard conversion but in lowercase.\n\nFirst, I should create a mapping of the Roman numerals to their values. Let me list out the standard symbols up to 1000:\n\nI = 1\nV = 5\nX = 10\nL = 50\nC = 100\nD = 500\nM = 1000\n\nWait, but for numbers like 400, it's CD, not CCCCM or something. So the function needs to accurately represent each digit or combination of digits.\n\nThe approach I usually see for Roman numeral conversion is to repeatedly subtract the largest possible Roman value from the number and append the corresponding symbol. But that method can sometimes miss cases where subtraction is needed, like in 94 (XCIV).\n\nAlternatively, a more accurate method is to work from the largest possible symbol down and subtract its value, adding the symbol to the result string each time. Let me think about how to handle that.\n\nI'll create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding numeral. I'll list them in descending order to process the largest values first. For example, the list would look like this:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),"], "idxs": [117], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [10.106512784957886]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called int_to_mini_roman that takes a positive integer and returns its Roman numeral equivalent as a lowercase string. The given examples show that for 19 it's 'xix', 152 is 'clii', and 426 is 'cdxxvi'. So first, I should figure out how to convert a number into Roman numerals.\n\nI remember there's a standard algorithm for this. Let me think about it. The approach is to break the number down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and each of those correspond to specific Roman numerals. The thousands place can be a maximum of 1000, but since the restriction is 1 <= num <=1000, 1000 is included.\n\nSo, the basic idea is to process the number in chunks of 1000, 100, 10, and 1. For each chunk, we determine how many times each value fits into it, subtract that from the number, and then append the corresponding Roman numerals to the result string.\n\nLet me outline the possible values and their corresponding Roman numerals:\n\n- Thousands: 1000 is 'm', but since the maximum is 1000, we can have 'm' at most once.\n- Hundreds: 100 is 'c', so multiples would be 'c', 'cc', 'ccc' for 100-300-900.\n- Tens: 10 is 'x', so 'x' for 10-19, 'xx' for 20-29, up to 'lxx' for 70, 'lxxx' for 90, 'xc' for 90 with a subtraction. Wait, but since we are building numerals in sequence, perhaps using additive notation, we might not need subtractive cases if the algorithm is designed properly.\n\nWait, no. The standard Roman numerals use subtractive notation for certain cases, like iv for 4 and ix for 9. But traditional conversion algorithms that just break numbers into thousands, hundreds, etc., might not account for those. However, for numbers up to 3999, a basic algorithm using additive notation with some subtractive rules can handle it.\n\nBut in this case, the function needs to return the correct Roman numeral for any number up to 1000. So to cover all cases correctly, the algorithm should handle numbers in such a way that subtractive numerals like 'IV' or 'IX' are used where necessary.\n\nBut perhaps for numbers up to 1000,"], "idxs": [127], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [10.9203519821167]}], "tstamp": 1755902656.8188503}

Otherwise, they don't.\n\nSo, I can think of using a frequency count for each string. One way to do this is by sorting each string and comparing them. Because when you sort a string, each unique character appears in order.

Oh, looking at the examples, I don't see any tests with uppercase letters. So I guess the problem treats uppercase and lowercase as different. So sorting will take care of that naturally, as it's case-sensitive by default.\n\nAnother approach: Convert both strings into a set and check if the sets are equal.

So, the function is called same_chars and takes two strings, s0 and s1. The examples given show that sometimes it returns True and sometimes False based on whether all the letters in both strings are exactly the same, regardless of their order and frequency.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the requirements are. The function should check if both strings have exactly the same set of characters. So, for example, if s0 is 'eabcdzzzz' and s1 is 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc', they both have e, a, b, c, d, and z, but s1 might have more d's or z's, but the key is that each character's count should match between the two.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking at the examples, the first example returns True. Let me see: s0 is 'eabcdzzzz' \u2014 so the letters are e, a, b, c, d, with z appearing four times. s1 is 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' \u2014 let me count the characters there. It starts with d repeated how many times? Let's see. The string is ddd followed by a bunch of z's, then d's again, then e, d, a, b, c.

So in that case, perhaps the counts do matter. Wait, let me look at the example:\n\nSample Input 1:\ns0: 'eabcdzzzz' (e, a, b, c, d, z, z, z, z) \u2014 9 characters\ns1: 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' \u2014 let's see, d appears multiple times, z's as well.

So both strings have the same set of characters, each occurring the same number of times but in different orders perhaps.\n\nWait, no, in the first example, the counts must match. Let me count:\n\ns0: 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and then four 'z's (wait, 'zzzz' is four). Wait, let me calculate: 'eabcdzzzz' is e, a, b, c, d, z, z, z, z, so that's 9 letters.

So perhaps use the Counter class from collections. So:\n\n- Import Counter from collections.\n- Create a Counter for s0 and s1.\n- If the two Counters are equal, return True, else False.\n\nSo the function would look like this:\n\nimport collections\n\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\n    return collections.Counter(s0) == collections.Counter(s1)\n\nWait, but what about the order?

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe function is supposed to decompose a number into its integer part and the decimal part. Then, return the decimal part. Oh right, so for example, if the input is 3.5, the integer part is 3 and the decimal is 0.5, so the function should return 0.5.\n\nHmm, how do I get the integer part and the decimal part in Python? Well, I remember that the int() function can be used to get the integer part of a number, but that just truncates it, which is exactly what we need here. So for the number, say x = 3.5, int(x) would be 3. Then, the decimal part would be x minus int(x). That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what about negative numbers? The problem statement says \"given a positive floating point number,\" so I don't have to worry about that. Good, so I don't need to handle negatives.\n\nWait, but what if the number is an integer like 5.0? Then the decimal part is zero. The function should return 0.0 in that case. So when I subtract int(x) from x, 5.0 - 5 is 0.0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case to consider: something like 4.9999. Then int(4.9999) is 4, and the decimal is 0.9999, which the function should return.\n\nSo the steps are: take the number, convert it to an integer to get the integer part, subtract that from the original number, and return the result.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me test this with an example. Let's say number = 3.5. int(number) is 3, so 3.5 - 3 is 0.5. Perfect. What about a number like 7.0000? Well, subtracting 7 gives 0.0, which is correct. What if the number is very tiny, like 0.0000001? Then the integer part is 0, and the decimal is 0.0000001, which should be returned as 0.0000001.\n\nBut in programming, sometimes there might be precision issues with floating points.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that the number can be decomposed into an integer part and decimals. So for example, if the input is 3.5, the integer part is 3, and the decimals are 0.5. The function should return just 0.5.\n\nWait, but how do I separate the integer part from the decimal part in Python? Oh right, maybe using the math module functions. There's math.floor which gives the largest integer less than or equal to a number. So for 3.5, math.floor(3.5) gives me 3, and then subtracting that from the original number would give 0.5.\n\nBut wait, what about negative numbers? Oh, the problem states that the input is a positive float, so I don't have to worry about that. Good.\n\nSo the steps are: take the input number, find the largest integer less than or equal to it (using math.floor), and then subtract that integer from the original number to get the decimal part.\n\nBut wait, what if the number is something like 4.9999999999? Because math.floor(4.999999) is 4, so subtracting gives 0.999999, but if the number was actually 4.999... due to floating point precision, maybe I should handle that. Although, the problem says the decimal part is the leftover smaller than 1, so that should be okay.\n\nSo putting it all together: import math, then for a given number, the decimal part is number - math.floor(number). But wait, what about when the number is exactly integer? Like 5.0. Then math.floor(5.0) is 5, so subtracting gives 0.0, which is correct according to the problem statement.\n\nSo the function can be implemented as returning number - math.floor(number). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, writing the code: first, import math. Wait, the function's parameters are given as a float, so I'll assume that the function is correctly given that.\n\nWait, but what about very large numbers or numbers with extreme decimal parts?

The examples show that truncate_number(3.5) should return 0.5. So, the function needs to somehow separate the integer part from the decimal and just return the decimal part.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, there are multiple ways to get the fractional part of a number. One common method is to subtract the integer part from the number itself. But to get the integer part, I can use operations like int(number) or math.floor(number). However, since the number is a float, I need to be careful with any potential floating point precision issues.\n\nWait, the problem says the function is given a positive floating point number, so I don't have to handle negative numbers.

Similarly, if the number is 4.0, the decimal part is 0 because it's already an integer. \n\nBut how do I calculate the decimal part accurately? Using the math library's functions might help, but I don't know if importing math is necessary here. Alternatively, I can use string manipulation. For instance, converting the number to a string, splitting on the decimal point, and taking the part after the point as the decimal_part, then converting it back to a float.\n\nHmm, but string methods can sometimes have issues with floating point precision. For example, 0.1 in binary can't be represented exactly, so the string might show more digits than intended. So maybe it's better to avoid that approach and use mathematical operations instead.\n\nAnother approach is to subtract the integer part from the number. So, the decimal_part equals number minus math.floor(number). However, wait\u2014what about cases where the number is exactly an integer? Then math.floor(number) would give the exact integer, so subtracting would result in 0.0, which is correct.\n\nBut I should test for an edge case. Let's say the number is 5.00001. The integer part is 5.0, and the decimal is 0.00001, which using the method would be 5.00001 - 5.0 = 0.00001, correct.\n\nWait, but what about when the number is 3.6? math.floor(3.6) would give"], "idxs": [107], "new_tokens": [520], "wall_time": [9.394134283065796]}, {"index": 3, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called truncate_number that takes a positive float and returns its decimal part.

Wait, but wait, can I just use the % operator? Let me think. For example, 3.5 % 1 should give 0.5. That seems to work. So if I take the number modulo 1, I get the decimal part.\n\nSo the function can be simple. Subtract the integer part from the original number. But how to get the integer part? Alternatively, using the math module's floor function on the number and then subtracting that from the original number. So, math.floor(number) would give the integer part.

So why not just use number % 1?\n\nBut wait, does the modulus operator with 1 work correctly for floats? I think it should, because 1 is the base for decimals.\n\nSo perhaps the function can be as simple as returning number - int(number). Does that work? Let me see for 3.5. 3.5 - 3 is 0.5. Yes.

So will this approach work correctly for such cases?\n\nWell, the problem says it's a positive floating point number, so I assume we need to handle standard cases. But, is there a better way than just subtracting the integer part?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the decimal module could help with precise decimal operations, but that might complicate the function.

The function should return a sorted list of all elements that don't have any even digits. And the list needs to be sorted in increasing order. \n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFirst example:\nInput: [15, 33, 1422, 1]\nOutput: [1, 15, 33]\nWait, why isn't 1422 included? Let's see. The number 1422 has digits 1,4,2,2. 4 and 2 are even, so yes, it gets excluded. So the output is numbers without any even digits. So 15 has 1 and 5, both odd. 33 is 3 and 3, also odd. 1 is single digit, odd.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: [152, 323, 1422, 10]\nOutput: []\nBecause let's see each number:\n152: digits 1,5,2. 2 is even. So exclude.\n323: digits 3,2,3. 2 is even. Exclude.\n1422: as before, excludes.\n10: 1 and 0. 0 is even. Exclude. So all are excluded, hence empty list.\n\nSo the problem is: for each number in x, check if all its digits are odd. If yes, include it; else, exclude it. Then, the resulting list should be sorted.\n\nSo the steps I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the input list x.\n2. For each number, extract its digits.\n3. Check if any of the digits are even.\n   a. If none are even, keep the number.\n   b. If any are even, discard the number.\n4. Collect all numbers that meet condition 3a.\n5. Sort them in increasing order and return as a list.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about each function.\n\nFirst, extract digits: For a number, I can convert it to a string, then iterate through each character, convert each to integer, and check if it's even.\n\nAlternatively, check each digit mathematically without converting to string.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the string method is easier to read and write.\n\nSo, for a given number n:\n\ndigits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]\n\nthen, check"], "idxs": [90], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.106835126876831]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called unique_digits that takes a list of positive integers and returns a sorted list of all elements that have no even digits. Hmm, so the goal is to check each number in the list and determine if all of its digits are odd. If yes, include it in the result; if not, skip it. Then, sort the resulting list in increasing order.\n\nFirst, let me think about the steps involved. For each number in the input list x, I should check if every digit is odd. How do I check that? Well, I can convert each number to a string, iterate through each character in the string, convert each character back to an integer, and then check if it's odd.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way than converting to a string. Alternatively, using modulo operations: for each digit, I can extract it and then check if it's even. But converting to a string might be easier and more readable, especially for someone new.\n\nSo for each number, n, in x, I do the following:\n1. Convert n to a string to get each digit.\n2. For each character in this string, convert it back to an integer and check if it's even.\n3. If even, mark this number as invalid and move to the next number.\n4. If all digits are odd, add the number to the result list.\n\nWait, but the sample input has 1422, which is 1,4,2,2. Since 4 and 2 are even, that number is excluded, which matches the first example.\n\nNow, for the function, I'll need to loop through each number in x. Let me outline the steps in code.\n\nInitialize an empty list, say result = [].\nLoop through each number in x:\n    Take the number, check all digits.\n    How? For example:\n        n = 15\n        Convert to string '15', then loop through each char:\n            '1' \u2192 1 (odd)\n            '5' \u2192 5 (odd)\n        So all digits are odd, include in result.\nSimilarly for 33: 3 and 3 are both odd.\nBut for 1422: digits are 1,4,2,2\u2014so even digits present, so not included.\n\nWhat about the number 10? It has 1 (odd) and 0 (even), so it's excluded.

Let's take the first example: unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]). The output is [1, 15, 33]. Let me check each number.\n\n15: digits are 1 and 5.

Here, 4 and 2 are even, so this number is excluded.\n1: only digit is 1, which is odd, so included.\n\nSo the output includes only those numbers that have all odd digits. That makes sense. \n\nThe second example: unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]) returns an empty list. Let's see why.\n\n152: digits are 1, 5, 2. 2 is even, so excluded.\n323: digits are 3, 2, 3.

For a given number, I can convert it into a string, then iterate over each character, check if each digit is even.

Wait, the note says 'positive integers', so zero isn't part of the input. So, the digits can be 0 only if the number itself is zero, which isn't in the input. Wait, actually, no.

The task is to check each number in the list and see if all its digits are odd. If yes, we include it in the result list, otherwise, we skip it.\n\nSo, the function will process each number in the input list x. For each number, I'll convert it into a string so I can iterate over each digit. Then, I'll check each digit to see if it's even. If any digit is even, the number is out. If none are even, add it to the result list.\n\nWait, how to handle numbers? Let's see. For a number, like 15, it's digits are 1 and 5. Both odd, so it's kept. For 33, same thing. But for 1422, the digits are 1,4,2,2. The 4 and 2 are even, so this number is excluded.\n\nI think the steps are: For each number in x, check all digits. If a single digit is even, discard.

Alternatively, I remember that checking the remainder when divided by 2 can tell if it's even or odd.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a digit d:\nif d % 2 == 0, then it's even.\n\nSo for each number in x, I can convert it to a string, iterate over each character, convert each character back to an integer, and check if any of them is even.\n\nFor example, let's take 15: digits are 1 and 5, both odd, so it's included.

Let me think through the examples provided to clarify.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nFor example, is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) returns True, which makes sense because it's strictly increasing and all numbers are unique. \n\nThen, is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) returns False because the list isn't in ascending order. \n\nAnother example is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which returns True.

But if any element occurs more than once, regardless of how it's sorted, the function should return False.\n\nWait, but in the sample, [1,2,2,3,3,4] returns True. So that seems contradictory.

The function is called concatenate and it takes a list of strings as an argument. The goal is to concatenate all the strings in the list into a single string. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should check if the list is empty. If there are no strings, I should return an empty string. That makes sense because there's nothing to concatenate.\n\nIf the list isn't empty, I need to go through each string in the list and combine them. In Python, one way to do this is by using a loop. Hmm, I can loop through each string in the list and add them to a result variable. So maybe I'll initialize an empty string and then iterate over each element in the list, appending each string to the result.\n\nAlternatively, since strings in Python are iterable, another way is to join all the elements in the list directly. That might be more efficient and cleaner. So, using the join method without a loop would work. But wait, does the join method work for all cases? Like, if a string in the list is empty, does it cause any issues? I don't think so because joining an empty string just skips that part, which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I can write a one-liner using the join method. If the list is empty, the join will return an empty string, which covers the first case. If the list has elements, it will concatenate them in order.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given. For an empty list, the code returns ''. That's correct. For ['a', 'b', 'c'], the join will produce 'abc', which is right.\n\nI should also consider other cases, like a list with one string. For example, ['hello'], it should return 'hello'. And a list with strings of different lengths, like ['ab', 'cd', 'ef'], should give 'abcdef'. So the approach seems solid.\n\nI think the code will be something like: return ''.join(strings).

So, I need to handle that case.\n\nThe second example is when the list has elements like ['a', 'b', 'c'], the function should return 'abc'. So, I need to join all the strings in the list.\n\nHow do I do that? Well, in Python, the join() method is used to concatenate an iterable of strings. So, for a list like ['a', 'b', 'c'], ''.join(list) would give 'abc'. But wait, the type annotation says it's a List[str]. So each element in the list is a string.

The function should handle both empty lists and lists with one or more strings.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward. We will use Python's built-in `join()` method, which is designed to concatenate an iterable of strings. This method is efficient and concise, and it will handle all edge cases, including when the list is empty.\n\nHere are the key steps for our approach:\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the input list is empty, the `join()` method will return an empty string, which is the desired result.\n2. **Concatenate all strings**: Use"], "idxs": [96], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [8.547024488449097]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Alright, I need to complete the code for the concatenate function.

That makes sense. Now, how do I implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I should check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string. Otherwise, loop through each string in the list and concatenate them. But in Python, strings can be directly added, unlike lists.\n\nWait, but what if the list has some empty strings? The function should still process them, right? So if the list has, say, ['', 'a', ''], the result should be 'a' because the empty strings don't contribute anything.\n\nSo, the steps are: initialize an empty string, then loop through each string in the input list, and add each string to the result. Don't forget to handle the case when the list is empty.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the sum function, because for lists of strings, sum congressman the concatenation. For example, sum(['a','b','c']) is 'abc' and sum\u03bb\u03adping an empty list returns ''. But wait, wait, does sum work correctly when the list contains empty strings?

So, actually, I can just return ''.join(list) regardless of whether the list is empty. Because ''.join on an empty list returns '' and on a non-empty list returns the concatenated string.\n\nWait, but ''.join on an empty list returns '', which matches the desired behavior. So perhaps the entire function can be written in one line: return ''.join(strings).\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples. For an empty list, it returns ''. For ['a', 'b', 'c'], it returns 'abc' as expected. What about with a mix of strings? Like ['a', '', 'b'], it should return 'ab'.

For the other case, it just concatenates all the strings.\n\nLet me test this logic mentally. For the example ['a', 'b', 'c'], ''.join would give 'abc'. For an empty list, it's ''. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. The goal is to take each string in the list, one after another, and combine them into a single continuous string. If the list is empty, the result should be an empty string.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward and efficient:\n1. **List Concatenation**: Use Python's built-in `join()` method, which is designed to concatenate an iterable of strings into a single string. This method is both concise and efficient for this use case.\n2. **Handling Empty List**: The `join()` method naturally handles empty lists by returning an empty string when there are no elements to concatenate.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List"], "idxs": [98], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [8.726553678512573]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called concatenate that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that's all the elements of the list concatenated together. Hmm, how do I do that.\n\nSo, the function is defined as def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str: Oh right, because the list is of string type. And it returns a string.\n\nI remember that in Python, you can use the join method to concatenate strings in a list into one. For example, if the list is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then joining them would give 'abc'. But wait, does that work only if all elements are strings? Yeah, because the list is List[str], so each element is a string.\n\nWhat if the list is empty, like the example shows, it should return an empty string. So I need to handle that case too.\n\nLet me think about the steps: I can take the list of strings, convert each element into another form if needed, but in this case, they're already strings. So, join the list into a single string and return it.\n\nWait, is there a way that the join method can handle an empty list? Let me check the examples. The first example is concatenate([]) which should return ''. So if I use ''.join(list) when the list is empty, does that work? Yes, because ''.join([]) would be an empty string.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function can be written using the join method. So, it would be something like return ''.join(strings). But wait, what about cases where the list is empty? Like if strings is an empty list, the function should return ''. But in Python, the join method on an empty list will already return an empty string without any issues. So I don't need any special handling for that.\n\nSo the code inside the function could be as simple as return ''.join(strings).\n\nLet me test this logic. For the sample inputs:\n\n1. concatenate([]) --> return ''.join([]) --> '' as expected.\n2. concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) --> ''.join(['a','b','c']) --> 'abc' as expected.\n\nWhat if there's only one string in the list? Say ['hello'], then the function would return 'hello', which is correct.\n\nAnother test case, what about different cases or special characters? Like ['He!', 'llo'], which should return 'He!llo'.

How does Python handle joining lists into strings? Oh right, I can use the join() method.\n\nWait, the function is defined with List[str], which means each element is a string. So I can loop through each string in the list and concatenate them, or just use join on the list. That's easier.\n\nSo the steps are: check if the list is empty, if not, join all the elements. So inside the function, something like if not strings: return ''. Else, return ''.join(strings).\n\nTesting the examples: if the list is empty, it returns ''. For ['a', 'b', 'c'], joining gives 'abc'. That works.\n\nDo I need to handle any edge cases? What if the list has one string? Like ['apple'], the function should return 'apple'. That should work.\n\nAlso, what about empty strings in the list? For example, ['', 'a'] should return 'a'. I think that's handled correctly by join, as empty strings are just added as is.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n    if not strings:\n        return ''\n    else:\n        return ''.join(strings)\n\nAlternatively, it can be written more concisely as:\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n    return ''.join(strings) if strings else ''\n\nOr even shorter, in one line using a conditional expression. Either way, both should work.\n\nI think that's all. The join method handles all cases, including empty lists and lists with various strings.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that concatenates a list of strings into a single string. If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty string. If the list contains one or more strings, the function should return a single string formed by concatenating all the strings in the list in the order they appear.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the input list is empty, return an empty string immediately.\n2. **Concatenate the strings**: If the list is not"], "idxs": [94], "new_tokens": [518], "wall_time": [8.390017986297607]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, so I need to complete this Python function called concatenate. The function takes a list of strings and returns a single concatenated string. Let's see what I know.\n\nFirst, the function signature is already given: it's a function named concatenate that takes a parameter strings of type List[str], and it returns a string. The docstring shows some examples, like when the list is empty, it returns an empty string, and when it's a list of 'a', 'b', 'c', it returns 'abc'. So the basic idea is to take all the strings in the list and put them together in order.\n\nHmm, how do I concatenate strings in Python? Oh right, using the '+' operator. So if I have a list, I can loop through each element and add them up.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty? Well, the code should return an empty string, which the function already handles.\n\nSo the steps are: iterate over each string in the list, concatenate them all. Maybe I can collect them in a variable as I go.\n\nLet me think of an example. If the list is ['hello', 'world', '!'], then I need to return 'helloworld!'.\n\nHow to implement this? I can initialize an empty string, maybe call it result. Then, for each string in strings, I add it to result. Using a for loop with a list comprehension or a simple loop.\n\nWait, could I use sum()? Because in Python, if you have a list of strings, using sum with an empty string as the initializer will concatenate them. Let me test that. Like, sum(['a', 'b', 'c'], '') gives 'abc'. That's a neat way. Oh, but only if all the elements are strings because sum works with numbers too. Since the type is List[str], it should be safe.\n\nSo the function could be as simple as returning the sum of the list with '' as the initial value.\n\nPutting it all together, the function would look like:\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n    return ''.join(strings)\n\nWait, another way is using ''.join(strings), which also concatenates all strings in the list. That's another option.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a generator expression inside sum, like sum(''.join(s) for s in strings). Or just sum([]) with initial value.\n\nWait, let me think.

So, if I have a list like ['a', 'b', 'c'], adding them together would need a way to combine all elements without knowing their exact order or number in advance. Maybe a loop is the right approach here.\n\nWait, another method comes to mind: the join() function. Oh right, because if I have a list of strings, joining them all without any separators would work perfectly. So I can use ''.join(list) to concatenate them. That makes sense because join takes an iterable and puts its elements together.\n\nSo the function will first check if the list is empty. If it is, return an empty string as specified in the examples. If not, return the joined result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Check if the input list is empty.\n2. If it is, return an empty string.\n3. Otherwise, join all the strings in the list and return the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that joining an empty list with any separator results in an empty string, maybe I don't need the explicit check. But looking at the sample input where the list is empty, it should return an empty string regardless.\n\nThus, the function could be written as returning the join of all elements in the list, safe in the knowledge that if the list is empty, it simply returns ''.\n\nWait, but sometimes, if there's a None in the list, join would throw an error. But the function is supposed to take List[str], so each element is a string, possibly an empty string, but not None. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the code inside the function would be something like:\n\nreturn ''.join(strings)\n\nBut wait, maybe I should handle the case where 'strings' is None? But the type hints say it's a list, so the function expects a list, not None. So no need to handle that.\n\nThus, the complete function is just:\n\nreturn ''.join(strings)\n\nBut let me also check the examples. For the empty list, it returns ''.

One common method in Python is to use the join() function, which takes an iterable (like a list) of strings and concatenates them together. So if I have a list like ['a', 'b', 'c'], joining them would give 'abc'.\n\nI also need to consider the edge cases. If the list is empty, the function should return an empty string. That should work with the join method because joining nothing results in nothing, which is the empty string.\n\nLet me check the sample cases provided. The first sample input is an empty list, and the expected output is ''. This will work because the join method handles empty iterables correctly.\n\nThe second sample is ['a', 'b', 'c'] and the expected output is 'abc'. Again, using join should handle this by simply concatenating each string in the order they appear in the list.\n\nSo the function can be implemented by using the ''.join() method on the input list. That's straightforward because the type hinting is already provided, so I can use that method directly.\n\nWait, but what if the list contains elements that are not strings?

It says to concatenate the list of strings into a single string. The examples cover the empty list and a list with three elements, which are both handled by the join method.\n\nSo the steps are: take the input list, join all elements with the empty string separator, and return the result.\n\nPutting it all together, the function can be written in one line.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to concatenate a list of strings into a single string.

If it's odd, the next term is three times it plus one. The sequence continues until it reaches 1. So, the task is to collect all the odd numbers that appear along this sequence and then return them sorted in increasing order.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the example provided.

Then, I apply the Collatz rule to get the next number.\n\nWait, for n=1, the sequence is just [1], which is odd, and the function should return [1], which makes sense.\n\nLet me think about another example to test this logic.

If it's even, the next number is half of it. If it's odd, the next number is three times it plus one. The sequence continues until it reaches 1.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that we need to collect the odd numbers from this sequence.

Let's think step by step.\n\nI can start by initializing a list to keep track of the sequence. I'll start with n as the first element. Then, while n is not equal to 1, I'll compute the next number based on whether n is even or odd. Each time, I append the current n to the list before updating it.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. The way the Collatz sequence works, each step is n becomes the next number. So starting with n, then each step is n equals the previous step's transformation. So, the sequence is [n, n1, n2, ...] down to 1.\n\nBut I need to collect all the odd numbers in this sequence.

Then, I have to return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes respectively.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, what is a palindrome? A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for example, 121 is a palindrome because reversing it gives the same number. Similarly, 3 is also a palindrome because it's just one digit.\n\nSo, given a number n, I need to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n, check if each is a palindrome, and then categorize them based on whether they are even or odd.\n\nWait, but how do I check if a number is a palindrome? One way is to convert the number to a string and then check if the string is equal to its reverse. For example, str(121) is \"121\", and reversing it gives \"121\", so it's a palindrome.\n\nYes, that's a simple method. So for each number in the range, I can convert it to a string and compare it with its reversed version.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each number from 1 to n.\n2. For each number, check if it's a palindrome.\n3. If it is a palindrome, check if it's even or odd.\n4. Maintain counters for even and odd palindromes.\n\nThat makes sense. Let's outline the code structure.\n\nI'll initialize two counters: even_pal and odd_pal to zero.\n\nThen, loop through each num in range(1, n+1). For each num, convert to string, check if it equals its reverse. If yes, then check if num is even (num % 2 == 0). If even, increment even_pal. Otherwise, increment odd_pal.\n\nWait, but wait, when checking for palindrome numbers, there's a more efficient way, especially for larger numbers, but since n can be up to 1000, which is manageable, the string method should be fine.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    even = 0\n    odd = 0\n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        s = str(num)\n        if s == s[::-1]:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even +=1\n            else:\n                odd +=1"], "idxs": [83], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [7.6043806076049805]}], "tstamp": 1755903258.3105097}

The function should check if 'a' can be expressed as the product of exactly three primes. They can be the same prime or different. For example, 30 is 2*3*5, which are all primes, so it returns True.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. I need to find out all the possible triplets of prime factors of 'a' and check if such a triplet exists.\n\nWait, but what if 'a' has more than three prime factors, but one of them occurs more than once? For example, 2*2*2*3*5 would have five prime factors but if I take into account multiplicity, like maybe 2*2*3*5 is a product of four primes, but we're looking for three primes multiplied. Hmm, wait no. The function needs the product to be exactly three primes, so if there are more than three prime factors, even with multiplicity, it shouldn't qualify unless when considering the count properly.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. For example, 30 has three distinct primes, 2,3,5. 12 is 2*2*3, which is two distinct primes but three when considering their count because 2 appears twice. But in that case, 12 equals 2*2*3, which is three primes (two 2s and one 3). So in this case, 12 should return True.\n\nSo, the approach should consider both distinct primes and primes with multiplicity. So, the function needs to ensure that when the number a is factorized into primes, the total count (including multiplicity) is exactly three. So, for example, 30 has three distinct primes, which counts as three, and 12 has two distinct primes but three factors in total, so it also should be considered as three primes multiplied.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1.

The first thing that comes to mind is that I need to find the prime factors of a and check if there are exactly three of them, counting multiplicity. Wait, actually, multiplicity might be a point to consider. For example, if a is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8, does that count as three primes? Well, in the example given, 30 is 2 * 3 * 5, which are three distinct primes, but the problem doesn't specify that they need to be distinct. Hmm, I need to clarify that. \n\nWait, the example shows 30 as True, which is 2, 3, and 5\u2014distinct primes. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly say whether the primes have to be distinct. So perhaps I need to consider both cases. However, since the problem says \"the multiplication of 3 prime numbers\", it's possible that they can be the same. But I should probably just consider all prime factors, regardless of duplication. So the key is to find if the total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) is exactly three.\n\nSo the plan is: factorize a into its prime factors, count how many there are, and check if that count is exactly three.\n\nFirst, I'll need a way to find the prime factors of a number. Let's think about writing a helper function for that. But since a is less than 100, it's manageable without optimizing too much.\n\nStep 1: Find all the prime factors of a, including their multiplicity.\n\nFor example:\n- a = 30: factors 2, 3, 5 \u2192 3 factors \u2192 return True.\n- a = 8: factors 2, 2, 2 \u2192 3 factors \u2192 return True.\n- a = 7: factors just 7 \u2192 1 factor \u2192 False.\n- a = 4: factors 2, 2 \u2192 2 factors \u2192 False.\n- a = 15: 3, 5 \u2192 but let's see: 3*5*1?

So, my function needs to check whether a can be expressed as the product of exactly three primes, considering their multiplicities.\n\nFirst, I should think about the steps involved. Maybe the function should perform prime factorization on a and check if the total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) is three.\n\nSo, step one is to find all the prime factors of a. To do this, I can loop from 2 upwards, checking each number to see if it's a factor of a. If it is, I'll add it to the list of factors and then divide a by this factor until it's no longer divisible. This should give me the prime factors with their multiplicities.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Like, for 30, the factors would be 2, 3, 5. That's three primes, so it should return True. For a number like 4, which is 2*2, the factors are [2,2], which is two primes, so it should return False.\n\nAnother example: 105 is 3*5*7, so it's three primes and should return True.

Looking at the example, 30 is 2*3*5, which are three distinct primes. So I think the function should check if a can be written as a product of exactly three primes, which may or may not be distinct. But wait, the problem statement says the multiplication of three prime numbers. So perhaps they can be same or different. But in reality, since primes are greater than 1, multiplying three of them gives a number that might be as low as 2*2*2=8.

Well, I know that in Python, you can loop through the list and keep track of the longest string found so far.

Then, for each string in the list, I compare its length to the current longest_str's length.\n\nWait, but if the list is empty, I should return None. So maybe before even starting the loop, I should check if the list is empty. If it is, return None. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nIf I proceed, I'll need to keep track of the current longest's length and the string itself. So maybe I can have two variables: max_length and max_str.

So initial max_str can be the first element, and we'll compare all the others.\n3. Loop through each string in the list starting from the second element (since the first is already set as max_str). For each string, get its length.\n4. If the current string's length is greater than the max_str's current length, then update max_str to this string.\n5.

That's straightforward.\n\nNow, for the case where the list isn't empty. I need to find the string with the maximum length. I remember that in Python, the max() function can be used on a list of strings, but wait, does max() work with lists of varying data types? Oh no, the arguments to max() should be the elements in the list. But wait, in my loop, I have each string, so using max() on the lengths would be better, but no, I think I need to get the actual strings.\n\nLet me think about the approach. I can initialize a variable to keep track of the longest string found so far. Let's call it max_str. Maybe set it to None initially so that any non-empty string will replace it.\n\nThen, I'll loop through each string in the list. For each string, I check if its length is greater than the length of max_str.

The loop should just keep the first one, because once a longer string is found, it becomes the new max_str, and if a string with the same length as max_str comes later, since its length isn't greater, max_str doesn't change, so the first one remains.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

For example, in the test case ['a', 'bb', 'ccc'], the function correctly returns 'ccc'. But if the list was ['ccc', 'bb', 'a'], it should still return 'ccc' because it's the first.\n\nBut in the code, as we iterate from left to right, when a longer string is found, it replaces the current max.

So first, I need to find out the length of the given string.\n\nWait, how do I get the length of a string in Python? Oh right, using the len() function. So I'll start by creating a variable to store the string's length.\n\nOnce I have the length, I need to check if it's a prime number. I think I should write a helper function to check for primality because if I put the code there, it'll keep things clean.\n\nLet me think about the helper function. It needs to take a number and return True if it's prime, else False. So, first, if the number is less than 2, return False. Then, check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. Because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so checking up to there is efficient.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the square root?

That function will take an integer and return True if it's prime, False otherwise.\n\nLet me outline the is_prime function.

Or maybe I can do it inline.\n\nLet me outline the is_prime function. The standard way is to check divisibility up to the square root of the number. So for a given number n, check if any number from 2 up to sqrt(n) divides n evenly. If yes, it's not prime.

Let's say n is the number to check. If n is less than 2, return False. Then, for i in range from 2 to sqrt(n) + 1, because if the square is an integer, we need to include the limit.

The problem says to look for even elements that are at odd indices. Wait, that's a bit tricky.

The task is to add the even elements that are located at odd indices. Hmm. Wait, is the index starting at 0 or 1 here? Because in Python, lists are zero-indexed.

Because Python uses zero-based indexing. So the first element is index 0, which is even, then index 1 is odd, and so on. So, I need to consider elements at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., but only if those elements are even. Then sum all those even elements.\n\nLet's look at the example provided.

I think in English, vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. But wait, in this problem, does Y count as a vowel? The examples provided don't include Y, so maybe not.

Or maybe it's better to handle it after swapping the case, because the original case doesn't matter for the replacement.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the original character is a vowel, like 'A' or 'a'. After swapping case, it becomes 'a' or 'A', but the replacement is based on the vowel's position in the alphabet, regardless of case.

But wait, the same pair shouldn't be checked twice, like only compare each pair once to avoid redundant checks.\n\nAlternatively, the other way is to get the square of each element and compare them. Because if two numbers are close, their squares are also close, which avoids dealing with the square root or negative numbers, which isn't necessary here since the threshold is absolute.\n\nLet me think about the steps. So, for each number in the list, compare it with every other number that comes after it in the list. Because I don't want to check every pair twice, like (a,b) and (b,a).

The first thing that comes to mind is that I need to compare every pair of numbers in the list to see if the absolute difference between them is less than the threshold.

That way, every possible pair is checked once.\n\nI should also consider the case where the list has fewer than two elements.

So I need to include a check at the beginning of the function: if the length of the list is less than 2, return False.\n\nNext, I'll need to iterate through the list.

But in this problem, the requirement is to round away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers.\n\nSo, let's break down the problem. For a given number x, I need to check if x is exactly in the middle of two integers, say n and n+1. The midpoint between n and n+1 is n + 0.5. So, if x equals n + 0.5, we should round it away from zero, which means rounding to n+1 if n is positive or n-1 if n is negative.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. The problem says to round away from zero. So, for \"14.5\", which is 14.5, the integers are 14 and 15. The distance from both is 0.5. So, which one is farther from zero? 15 is 15 units away, while 14 is -14, which is 14 units away. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the distance is absolute. So, for 14.5, both 14 and 15 are 0.5 away. But since it's equidistant, we need to round away from zero. So, 14 is closer to zero, 15 is farther.

To do this, I can round the number normally, but wait, the usual Python round function rounds to the nearest integer, and for halfway cases, it rounds to the nearest even integer. Oh, but in this problem, if it's exactly halfway, I need to round away from zero. So the default behavior of the round function might not suffice.\n\nLet me think about some examples. For instance, 14.5: the closest integers are 14 and 15, each one away. According to the note, we should return 15. Similarly, -14.5 should return -15 because it's three? Wait, no. -14.5 is between -15 and -14. The distance from zero is 14.5 for both -14.5 and 14.5, but wait no. The distance to zero is different. Wait no, original note says that the number is equidistant from two integers, so for -14.5, it's equidistant from -15 and -14. So the function should return -15 because it's rounding away from zero. So the idea is, when the decimal part is exactly .5, we round up or down based on the sign.\n\nSo maybe, the approach is to find the nearest integer, but when it's exactly halfway, adjust it to move away from zero.\n\nHmm.

For example, num - integer_part would give the fractional part.

Hmm, so 15.3 is closer to 15 than to 16. \n\nWait, but the note says that if the number is equidistant, round it away from zero. So for example, 14.5 is equidistant between 14 and 15. Since we round away from zero, 14.5 would become 15, not 14. Similarly, -14.5 would become -15 because rounding away from zero would make it more negative.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle cases where the input is a string, which can represent both integers and floats.

So for 14.5, it would round to 14, which is not what we want. We want 15.\n\nSo I need to find a way to round .5 cases away from zero.

So I'll probably have to convert the string into a list of characters to manipulate them. Oh right, because strings are sequences, but you can't modify each character in place.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014another way might be to iterate through each character and build a new string with flipped cases. That sounds manageable.\n\nSo, I can loop through each character in the input string. For each character, I check if it's a lowercase letter. If it is, I'll convert it to uppercase. If it's already uppercase, I'll make it lowercase. And if it's not a letter, maybe I just leave it as is or... well, wait, the problem says lowercase and uppercase characters, so perhaps other characters like punctuation or numbers don't need changing.\n\nWait, the examples show 'Hello' becoming 'hELLO'.

So, the function needs to process each character individually.\n\nSo, how can I check if a character is lowercase or uppercase? Using islower() and isupper() methods. So for a given char, if char.islower() is True, then I'll convert it to uppercase with char.upper(). Else, if char.isupper() is True, then convert to lowercase with char.lower().

Maybe using a list comprehension would be the way to go, appending each converted character.\n\nWait, another idea: for each character, change its case using the swapcase() method. Oh right!

The example is 'Hello' becomes 'hELLO'.\n\nUsing swapcase: 'Hello'.swapcase() would be 'hELLO'. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the function will just return string.swapcase()\n\nThat's much simpler than handling each character individually.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef flip_case(string: str) -> str:\n    return string.swapcase()\n\nThat's concise and should work for all cases, including other letters and even if the string has numbers or symbols, those are left as they are.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that flips the case of each character in a given string. This means converting all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase, while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward and efficient.

Maybe I can loop through each character in the input string and check if it's lowercase or uppercase.\n\nWait, for each character, if it's lowercase, I convert it to uppercase, else if it's uppercase, I convert it to lowercase.

Oh, the problem statement doesn't mention them, so I guess I can leave them as is.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use the swapcase() method. Does that exist? Let me recall. Yes, I think the string method swapcase() does exactly that. It converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa, leaving other characters unchanged. That's perfect!\n\nSo the function will take the input string, apply swapcase(), and return the result. That should handle everything without needing explicit loops or conditionals.

Then the rest of the letters follow the same pattern. So applying swapcase() would give exactly that.\n\nAnother test case: if the string is 'aBc', it should become 'Abc'. Similarly, 'ABC' becomes 'abc'. What about mixed cases and non-letters? For example, 'aB123!' would become 'Ab123!'. That makes sense.\n\nSo the code would simply be to return string.swapcase().

I guess I can loop through each character in the string. For each character, I'll check if it's uppercase or lowercase.\n\nWait, how do I check if a character is uppercase or lowercase in Python? Oh right, I can use the isupper() and islower() methods. So, for each character c in the string, if c.islower() is True, then I change it to uppercase, else if c.isupper() is True, change it to lowercase. But wait, what about characters that are neither?

Probably, we just leave them as they are since the problem doesn't mention them.\n\nSo the plan is to iterate over each character, decide whether to flip the case, and build a new string from these transformed characters.\n\nHow to implement this in Python. One way is to create a list to collect the transformed characters.

Each bucket can hold 'c' units, so the number of buckets needed for that well is 'w // c' if w is a multiple of c, but since you can have multiple wells contributing to a single bucket operation, I think it's more about how the water is distributed over the various buckets.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about example 1.\n\nExample 1:\n\nGrid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], each row sums to 1,1,3 respectively. So total water to move is 5.\n\nEach bucket has capacity 1. Each time I lower the bucket, I can take 1 unit from any well. So for row 0: 1 unit, which needs 1 trip. Row 1: 1 unit, another trip.

So, for a row with k 1s, you need to use the bucket k / capacity times, assuming you don't have leftovers.

So, when I lower a bucket, it can collect water from all the wells it can reach. Wait, the description is a bit vague on how the buckets exactly collect the water.

So, for each well (row), we can use its bucket to extract water from it. \n\nBut then, when we lower a bucket, how many times do we count that action? Each time we lower a bucket, regardless of how much water it collects, counts as one action.

Oh, according to the problem statement, all nodes have non-negative integer values, so I don't have to worry about that.

For each element, I have to check two things: whether the value is even and then find the one with the smallest value among the even ones, and if there's a tie, the earliest index.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the array, keeping track of the current smallest even value and its index.\n2. For each element, check if its value is even.\n3. If it's even, compare it with the current smallest even. If it's smaller, or if it's the first even found, then update the current smallest even and its index.\n4. After processing all elements, if we found any even value, return a list containing that value and its index. Otherwise, return an empty list.\n\nLet me think about how to handle this.\n\nI can initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index. Let's say, initially, the smallest even is None and the index is -1 (though in zero-based indexing, so maybe -1 isn't correct. Alternatively, I can set the smallest value to a very high number and the index to -1, so that any found even will be smaller.)\n\nWait, let's detail the steps:\n\n- Initialize variables: smallest_even = None, smallest_index = -1.\n\nThen, loop over each element in the array with their indices:\n\nfor index, value in enumerate(arr):\n\n- For each value, check if it's even. How? value % 2 == 0.\n\nIf value is even:\n\n- If smallest_even is not set yet (i.e., it's None), then set smallest_even to value and smallest_index to index.\n\n- Else, compare the current value with smallest_even:\n\n   - If current value is less than smallest_even: update smallest_even and index.\n\n   - Else if current value is equal to smallest_even: check if current index is smaller than the existing smallest_index.

Wait, but when calculating the sum, do I treat each negative digit as is or is it just about the overall sign? Wait no, I think the digits for negative numbers have their first digit negative. So for -123, the digits are '-', '1', '2', '3'? Or wait, maybe the negative sign is considered as a character but not part of the digits, but in this context, the digits would be the digits as they are, including any negative signs. Wait, wait the example says -123 has digits -1, 2, 3. So perhaps each digit after the sign is processed as is. So for the sum, we'd add -1 + 2 + 3, which is 4, which is positive. But according to the sample, when count_nums is called with [-1, 11, -11], it returns 1. Let's check that.\n\nWait, let's see. In the sample, [-1, 11, -11], the function returns 1. Let's calculate each one:\n- -1: the digits are -1. Sum is -1, which is not >0.\n- 11: digits are 1 and 1, sum is 2.\n- -11: digits are -1 and 1, sum is 0.\n\nWait so in this case, only 11 would count, making the total 1. But according to the function, the output is 1. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but for -11, the sum is -1 + 1 = 0, so it doesn't count.\n\nSo the function counts how many elements have a digit sum greater than zero.\n\nOkay, so the plan is: for each number in the array, split it into its digits, considering the sign as part of the first digit if it's negative. Then sum all the digits, and if the sum is greater than zero, count that number.\n\nSo, the steps for each number:\n\n1.

For each number in the array, I need to break it down into its individual digits, sum them up, and then check if the sum is greater than zero.\n\nFirst, I should probably handle both positive and negative numbers. But wait, for negative numbers, it's the first digit that's negative. So for -123, the digits are -1, 2, 3. Similarly, for a number like -505, the digits are -5, 0, 5.

So, for each number in the array, I need to break it down into its digits, considering the sign, sum them up, and then check if the sum is positive.\n\nLet me think about how to handle both positive and negative numbers. For a positive number like 11, the sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which is positive. For negative numbers, like -11, the digits are -1 and 1. A negative sign on the digit: does that mean the first digit is negative, and the rest are positive? So -123 would have digits as -1, 2, 3.

Sum is 0, which is not >0, so not counted.\n\nSo why does it return 1? Because only 11 is counted. That matches the sample.\n\nWait wait the sample output is 1. So that makes sense.\n\nAnother sample: [1, 1, 2] all digits sum to 1, 1, 2, so all are counted, which gives 3.\n\nSo, the function needs to iterate through each number in the array, compute the sum of its digits, considering the first digit as negative if the number is negative. Then count how many elements have a sum >0.\n\nSo, the steps for each number:\n\n1. Convert the number into its individual digits, with the first digit (if negative) being treated as negative.\n2. Sum these digits.\n3. If the sum is >0, increment the count.\n\nWait, how to extract the digits, considering the sign?\n\nLet me"], "idxs": [93], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.261742353439331]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called count_nums that takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements where the sum of their digits is greater than 0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I understand that each number can be negative or positive. For negative numbers, the first digit is negative, but when summing the digits, the sign only affects the first digit. So, for example, -123 has digits -1, 2, 3. Wait, but when I sum them, does it treat the negative sign as part of the digit or not? Or maybe the negative sign is just part of the first digit's value. So for -123, the digits are -1, 2, 3, and their sum is (-1) + 2 + 3 = 4, which is greater than 0. But in the sample input, like [-1, 11, -11], the function should return 1. Let's see: -1 has digits -1, sum is -1, which is less than 0. 11 has digits 1 and 1, sum is 2, which is good. -11 has digits -1 and 1, sum is 0, because -1 + 1 is 0. So only 11 is valid, hence 1.\n\nSo, the key is to process each number, break it into its digits, considering the sign of each digit. Wait, no, actually, the first digit is negative if the number is negative. So for -123, the digits are -1, 2, 3. So for each number, I need to split it into its individual digits, regardless of the sign, but the sign affects only the first digit.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each number in the input array.\n2. For each number, convert it into its digits, considering the sign of each digit as per the rules.\n3. Sum all those digits.\n4. Check if the sum is greater than 0. If yes, count it.\n5. Finally, return the total count.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to correctly extract the digits, including the sign for the first digit if the number is negative.\n\nSo, let's think about how to split a number into its digits.\n\nFor example, take the number 123.

Similarly, for 32, it's \"db100000db\". \n\nFirst, let me think about how to convert a decimal number to binary in Python. Oh right, I remember that the bin() function converts a number to a binary string prefixed with '0b'. So bin(15) gives '0b1111', which is exactly what I need except for the 'db' parts.\n\nSo the plan is: I'll take the decimal number, convert it to binary using bin(), remove the '0b' prefix, then wrap it with 'db' on both sides.

So '1111' becomes 'db1111db'.\n\nWhat about zero? If the input is 0, bin(0) gives '0b0', so slicing [2:] gives '0'. Then adding 'db' around gives 'db0db'. That seems correct.\n\nWait, what if the decimal is negative? Well, the problem statement says it's a decimal number, but what about negative numbers? The examples are positive, so perhaps the function is intended for non-negative decimals.

But the bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b', which I don't want. So I need to slice that part off.\n\nWait, for example, bin(15) gives '0b1111'. So, I can take the part after '0b' which is '1111', add 'db' at the beginning and end, making it 'db1111db'. That's correct according to the first example.\n\nBut wait, what if the number is zero? Because bin(0) returns '0b0', so slicing would give '0'. Then I need to add 'db' on both sides, making 'db0db'. Hmm, but let me check the examples. The first example is 15, which is 1111 in binary.

The function should return a string that starts with \"db\", followed by the binary representation, and ends with \"db\". So, basically, the binary digits are sandwiched between \"db\" at both ends.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to convert a decimal number to binary. I remember that one common method is to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainders. Those remainders, read in reverse order, give the binary representation. For example, converting 15 to binary:\n\n15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1\n7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1\n3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1\n1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\nSo reading the remainders from bottom to top gives 1111. That's how I get \"1111\" for 15.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in Python? Well, I can use a loop where I continuously divide the number by 2 and collect the remainders. Then, I reverse the collected remainders to get the correct binary string.\n\nBut wait, what about handling the remainder when the number is 0? If the input is 0, should the function return \"db0db\" or just \"db0db\"? The examples given by the user include 15 and 32. Let me check what the user expects when the input is 0.\n\nLooking back, the examples don't cover 0, but the function should probably handle it. If the input is 0, dividing by 2 will give 0 with a remainder of 0. So the binary would be \"0\", and thus the function would return \"db0db\".\n\nOkay, so the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Handle the special case when the input is 0.\n2. Use a loop to divide the number by 2, collecting remainders.\n3. Convert the collected remainders into a string, then reverse it to get the correct binary order.\n4. Surround this binary string with \"db\" at both ends.\n\nWait, the examples provided by the user show that for 15, the function returns \"db1111db\". So the binary part is 1111, which matches the calculation I did earlier.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to convert a decimal number to binary, I can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. Those remainders will be the binary digits, probably from least significant bit to most significant. So, for example, converting 15 to binary goes like this:\n\n15 divided by 2 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1.\n3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1.\n1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo reading the remainders from last to first gives 1111. That matches the example where decimal_to_binary(15) returns \"db1111db\". Oh wait, so the function needs to add 'db' at the start and end of the binary string.\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Convert the given decimal number to its binary string representation.\n2. Prepend 'db' to this string.\n3. Append another 'db' at the end.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nBut wait, how exactly is the binary string generated? Let me think. If I just use bin(number), it gives a string like '0b101' for 5. So I need to strip off the '0b' part first.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n- Take the input decimal number.\n- Use bin() to get the binary string without '0b'.\n- Then, take those binary digits as a string.\n- Prepend 'db' to it.\n- Append 'db' at the end.\n- Return this new string.\n\nWait, let me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFor 15, bin(15) is '0b1111', so the binary string is '1111'. Adding 'db' at the start and end gives 'db1111db'. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: 32 is 100000 in binary. So adding 'db' before and after gives 'db100000db'.

So the binary representation of 15 is 1111, but it's wrapped with 'db' at both ends. Similarly, 32 becomes \"db100000db\", which makes sense because 32 in binary is 100000. So the function needs to take the binary string, add 'db' at the start and end, and return that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to convert a decimal number to binary in Python. Oh right, there's the bin() function which returns a string that starts with '0b'. For example, bin(15) gives '0b1111'. So I can get the binary digits after the '0b' part.\n\nWait, but how do I handle negative numbers? The problem doesn't specify, but I should assume decimal is non-negative since we're dealing with binary numbers, which are positive by nature. But the question doesn't mention it, so maybe the function is intended for positive numbers only.\n\nAlright, for positive numbers, the steps are: get the binary string via bin(decimal)[2:], which strips off the '0b' part. Then, I need to prefix 'db' and suffix 'db' around this binary string.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function can be written as:\n\nTake the decimal number as input.

If decimal is 0, bin(0) returns '0b0', which becomes '0' when stripped. So the result should be 'db0db'.\n\nAnother test case: say decimal is 5.

The standard way in Python is to use the bin() function, which returns a string that starts with '0b'. So for 15, bin(15) gives '0b1111', for 32 it's '0b100000', and so on. So I think I can take that string, and then remove the '0b' part. That will give me the binary digits without the '0b' prefix.\n\nOnce I have the binary digits, I need to prepend and append 'db' to form the required string. So the process would be: take the binary string (without '0b'), add 'db' at the beginning, add the binary digits, and then add 'db' at the end. So for 15, after getting '1111', the function would return 'db1111db'.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, 32 returns 'db100000db'. So the binary part is '100000', which is 6 digits, adding the 'db's makes 8 digits in total, but actually, 6 digits, plus 'db' on both ends, so total length is 8.

But since we have to add 'db' at both ends, it becomes 'db0db'.

That makes sense based on the examples given.\n\nWait, what about cases where the binary has leading zeros after converting? No, wait, because when you convert a decimal to binary, leading zeros aren't part of the regular representation. So, the function bin() won't include any leading zeros unless the number is zero.

Assign the corresponding letter grade based on that threshold.\n\nLet me outline the thresholds as per the problem statement:\n\n- GPA >= 4.0 \u2192 A+ (But the way it's written, it's only 4.0 exactly, so maybe 4.0 is the only value for A+)\n- >3.7 \u2192 A\n- >3.3 \u2192 A- \n- >3.0 \u2192 B+\n- >2.7 \u2192 B \n- >2.3 \u2192 B-\n- >2.0 \u2192 C+\n- >1.7 \u2192 C \n- >1.3 \u2192 C-\n- >1.0 \u2192 D+ \n- >0.7 \u2192 D \n- >0.0 \u2192 D- \n- Exactly 0.0 \u2192 E\n\nWait, the way the problem states it is a bit confusing. Let me read the table again.\n\nThe table shows that 4.0 is mapped to A+ but then the next row is >3.7 being A. So I think that's a typo. Probably, it's that 4.0 is A+ and everything above 3.7 is A, which would include 4.0, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe 4.0 is the highest and gets A+ and the rest of the grades above 3.7 but below 4.0 get A. Hmm, I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the example they give is grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) which returns ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']."], "idxs": [100], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [8.88895845413208]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a list of GPAs into letter grades based on a specific table provided. The function is called numerical_letter_grade and it takes a list of grades as input. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. The function needs to go through each GPA in the list and determine the corresponding letter grade based on the given thresholds. The example shows that each grade is evaluated against these thresholds and assigned a specific letter.\n\nLet me look at the table again. The letter grades are determined by specific GPA ranges. For example, a GPA of 4.0 is an A+, and if it's above 3.7, then it's an A. If it's above 3.3, it's an A-, and so on. There's also a 0.0 GPA which is an E.\n\nSo the plan is to check each GPA against these thresholds in order and assign the corresponding letter. The thresholds go from highest to lowest, starting with 4.0, then 3.7, down to 0.0, which is the E.\n\nI think I should create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the threshold and the corresponding letter grade, sorted in descending order. This way, when I iterate through each grade, I can check against each threshold starting from the highest.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, the higher the GPA, the higher the grade.

Each condition only applies if the previous ones are not met. For example, only if a GPA is <= 3.7 but > 3.3, then it's an A-.\n\nI should create a list where each element is a tuple (threshold, letter).

The table shows that certain GPA thresholds determine the letter grade. For example, a GPA of 4.0 is an A+, and it's higher than 3.7 which is an A. Each threshold is greater than the previous one, so it's a series of if-else conditions I might need to implement.\n\nLet me write down the criteria:\n\n- 4.0 is A+\n- >3.7 is A\n- >3.3 is A-\n- >3.0 is B+\n- >2.7 is B\n- >2.3 is B-\n- >2.0 is C+\n- >1.7 is C\n- >1.3 is C-\n- >1.0 is D+\n- >0.7 is D\n- >0.0 is D-\n- 0.0 is E\n\nWait, the last one is 0.0 which is E, so if the GPA is exactly 0.0, it's E.

The elements are 1,2,4,3,5. Let's check each element from index 1 onwards.\n\n- Index 0 is 1, next is 2. Since 2 >=1, but we're looking for elements that are not >= previous.

So, for each element starting from the second one, I need to check if it is less than the previous element. Because if it's not greater than or equal, that means it's smaller, which is exactly the condition we're looking for.\n\nLet's take the examples given.\n\nFirst example: can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]).

Let's see.\n\nI can loop through the array from the second element to the end. For each element at index i, compare arr[i] with arr[i-1]. If arr[i] <= arr[i-1], then this is a candidate.

The goal is to return True if either b is a substring of a, or any of b's rotations are substrings of a. If none of those are true, we return False.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a rotation is. A rotation of a string is when you move some number of characters from the beginning to the end. For example, if b is \"abcd\", then its rotations are \"bcda\", \"cdab\", \"dabc\". So for each rotation, I need to check if it's present in a as a substring.\n\nWait, how do I generate all possible rotations of b? Well, for a string of length n, there are n possible rotations. So, for each i from 0 to len(b)-1, the ith rotation would be b[i:] + b[:i].\n\nBut wait, if I do that for each rotation, and then check each one against a, that could be computationally heavy if the strings are long.

So, maybe I can use a sliding window approach over b + b, taking substrings of the same length as b, and see if any of them are present in a.\n\nThat sounds promising. Let me try to think of an example.\n\nTake the first example: cycpattern_check(\"abcd\", \"abd\"). The second word is \"abd\". Let's generate its rotations. Rotations would be:\n\n- \"abd\" (original)\n- \"bda\"\n- \"dab\"\n\nSo, check if any of these are substrings of \"abcd\". \"abd\" isn't, \"bda\" isn't, \"dab\" isn't.

So, \"abd\" isn't a substring of \"abcd\" and its rotations. Rotations of \"abd\" would be \"db a\" (but since it's a 3-letter word, rotating once gives \"dba\"). None of these are in \"abcd\".\n\n2. cycpattern_check(\"hello\", \"ell\") returns True. \"ell\" is a substring of \"hello\" starting at index 1. Alternatively, checking if any rotation of \"ell\" is a substring. Since \"ell\" rotated once would be \"lle\", but that's not a substring. So, the main point is that the word itself is a substring.\n\nWait, no, actually \"ell\" is three letters, and \"hello\" has \"ell\" starting at index 1. So the function returns True.

So starting from position 3, we have 's s u p', which is \"ssup\". Not \"psus\". So no, it's False.\n\n4. cycpattern_check(\"abab\",\"baa\") returns True. The second word is \"baa\". Let's see: \"abab\" can have \"baa\" starting at index 1: 'abab'[1:4] is 'bab', which is not \"baa\". Wait, maybe I have to check all possible rotations.

For instance, cycpattern_check(\"abcd\",\"abd\") returns False because \"abd\" doesn't appear in \"abcd\" even after rotating b. But cycpattern_check(\"hello\",\"ell\") returns True because \"ell\" is a substring of \"hello\".\n\nWait, actually, rotating \"ell\" would be [\"ell\", \"lle\"], right?

Let me think about possible optimizations, but given the constraints aren't provided, maybe this straightforward approach is sufficient.\n\nSo the first step is to generate all rotations of b.\n\nHow do I generate rotations? For a string of length n, there are n rotations. The i-th rotation can be made by taking the substring from i to the end and then from the beginning to i.\n\nFor example, for b = \"abcd\", the rotations would be:\n\n- rotation 0: abcd\n- rotation 1: bcda\n- rotation 2: cdab\n- rotation 3: dabc\n\nWait, no.

A rotation of a string can be formed by moving some number of characters from the beginning to the end. For example, rotating \"abcd\" once would give \"bcda\", rotating it twice would give \"cdab\", and so on. So for a string of length n, there are n possible rotations.\n\nThe task is to generate all possible rotations of the second string 'b' and then check if any of them exists as a substring in the first string 'a'. If at least one rotation is found, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n1. Generate all possible rotations of string b.\n2. For each rotation, check if it is a substring of string a.\n3. If any rotation is found as a substring, return True.\n4. If none are found after checking all rotations, return False.\n\nLet me think about how to generate all rotations. For a string of length n, the i-th rotation can be created by taking the substring from index i to the end and then appending the substring from the start to index i. For example, for s = \"abcd\" and i=1, rotation would be \"bcda\".\n\nIn Python, I can loop from 0 to len(b) - 1, get each rotation, and collect all unique ones. But wait, what if rotating by m positions where m is less than len(b) might give the same rotation as some other value. Like, rotating \"abc\" by 1 gives \"bca\", rotating it by 2 gives \"cab\", which is different from the original. So maybe for each rotation, regardless of how many times it's applied, as long as it's a distinct rotation, I should include it.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"any of its rotations\". So each possible rotation, including the original string (rotating by 0), should be checked.\n\nNow, once I have all the rotations for 'b', I can check each one against 'a' to see if it is a substring.\n\nBut generating all rotations and then checking each one might be time-consuming for very long strings, but given that the constraints here aren't specified, and in the examples, the strings are manageable, it"], "idxs": [100], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [8.836543560028076]}, {"index": 4, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word.

A rotation of a word is when you move some characters from the beginning to the end. For example, if the word is \"hello\", one rotation could be \"elloh\" (moving the first 'h' to the end). Another rotation would be \"llohe\", and so on for all possible positions.\n\nWait, how do I generate all possible rotations of a string? Let me think. If the string is of length n, there are n possible rotations. Each rotation i can be created by taking the substring from i to the end and then appending the substring from 0 to i-1.\n\nSo for each rotation of b, I'll generate all possible rotated versions and then check if any of these is a substring of a.\n\nBut wait, how efficient is this? If the second word is long, say 1000 characters, this could generate a lot of rotations and might be slow. But given the examples, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. I know that using string concatenation can generate all possible rotations. For example, for a string b, all rotations can be found in b + b as each possible substring of length len(b) represents a rotation.\n\nSo instead of generating each rotation and checking each one, I can create a longer string by concatenating b with itself and then look for any occurrence of this in a concatenated string of a with itself. Hmm, that might be a more efficient way.\n\nLet me see. For example, for b = \"abd\", the concatenated string would be \"abdabd\".

For example, rotating \"abc\" by one would give \"bca\", and so on. So for the word 'b', its rotations would include 'b', 'b', etc., since it's only one character. For longer words, each rotation shifts all the letters by one position.\n\nThe function needs to return True if the second word b or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word a.

The function given is cycpattern_check(a, b), and I need to return True or False based on this condition.\n\nLet me think about what exactly a rotation is. A rotation of a string means that you move some characters from the beginning to the end. For example, rotating \"abcd\" by one would give \"bcda\". So, each rotation shifts all characters to the left, with the first character moving to the end.\n\nSo, the task is to check if any rotated version of the second string 'b' appears as a substring in the first string 'a'. If it does, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nFirst, I should generate all possible rotations of 'b'. How do I do that programmatically? Well, for a string of length n, there are n possible rotations. Each rotation can be created by taking the string and moving the first i characters to the end, where i ranges from 1 to len(b). Alternatively, for each i in 0 to len(b), create a string by slicing the original circularly.\n\nWait, but if I rotate by 0, that's the original string itself.

Therefore, the number of rotations is len(b), but for each rotation, I need to check if that particular rotated string is a substring of 'a'.\n\nWait a minute, does rotation by len(b) make sense? Let's see. For example, if 'b' is \"abcd\", rotation by 4 positions would get back to the original string. So, in that case, all possible unique rotations are from 0 to len(b)-1 positions, which gives len(b) different rotations, but some might be duplicates if the string has periodicity, like 'abab' which has rotations that might repeat earlier ones.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1.

I remember that the Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder, repeating this process until the remainder is zero.

Oh right, it's a process where you divide the larger number by the smaller one, then replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder. Repeat this until the remainder is zero, and the non-zero remainder just before that is the GCD.\n\nSo first, I need to handle cases where one of the numbers is zero.

So, for example, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5 because both can be divided by 5 exactly.\n\nWait, how do I actually compute the GCD? I recall there's the Euclidean algorithm which is efficient for finding the GCD. How does that work? It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then using the remainder to continue the process, right? Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nLet me think about the steps. Suppose a is larger than b. So, I divide a by b, get the quotient and remainder. Then, the GCD of a and b becomes the GCD of b and the remainder. I repeat this until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, for example, with a=25 and b=15: \n\n25 divided by 15 is 1 with a remainder of 10.

I need to implement this step where in each iteration, I take the previous divisor and the remainder and repeat.\n\nWait, maybe I should handle the case where a or b is zero because the GCD of any number with zero is the number itself. Oh, but the function's parameters are a and b as int, so perhaps the user can't input zero? Or maybe I should handle it. Let me think: if either a or b is zero, the GCD is the other number. So if a is zero, return b (if b is not zero), else zero. But wait, both a and b can't be zero because GCD is undefined in that case.

Maybe I should use that method rather than just brute-forcing it or using a simple loop.\n\nWait, how does the Euclidean algorithm work? Let me think. The basic idea is to subtract the smaller number from the larger one, right? But that's inefficient if the numbers are large. Oh, but if we use modulo instead of straight subtraction, it becomes more efficient because it can handle cases where subtraction would take many steps.\n\nSo the steps are something like this: divide the larger number by the smaller one, take the remainder, and then repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder.

The problem says that a path of length k visits exactly k cells. So if k is 3, I need to move from one cell to another two more times, making the total steps (or path length) 3.\n\nBut the path isn't just any path; it's about the values in the grid cells. We need the lexicographically smallest ordered list. Lexicographic order is like dictionary order, so for example, [1,2,1] is considered smaller than [1,3,3] because at the second position, 2 is smaller than 3.\n\nThe grid has N rows and N columns. Each value from 1 to N*N is present exactly once. So it's a Latin square in that sense.\n\nGiven that, how do I approach this?

That could get complicated because for each step, I need to consider all possible previous cells and then all their neighbors. That might lead to a lot of possibilities, especially for larger N and k.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: since we need the lex smallest path, we can think of building the path step by step, choosing at each step the smallest possible next cell, given the constraints of the path length.\n\nSo for k steps, the first cell in the path should be as small as possible, the second cell as small as possible given the first, and so on.\n\nBut how do we avoid cycles and ensure that the total path length is exactly k?

Each step in the path involves moving to a neighboring cell (sharing an edge), which means up, down, left, or right.\n\nThe path's length is k, which means visiting exactly k cells. The cells can include duplicates, so the path might revisit the same cell multiple times. However, since each cell has a unique value, the sequence of values from the path will be considered lex order.\n\nThe goal is to find the lex smallest path of length k. Lex order is determined by the first position where two paths differ, so the path that has the smallest possible number at the earliest possible position is the minimum.\n\nSo, to approach this, I think of it as a graph traversal problem, where each cell is a node connected to its four neighbors.

For each position in the path, we need the smallest possible value at that position. So the first cell should be as small as possible, then the second step as small as possible given the starting cell, and so on.\n\nHmm, that makes sense.

In programming, indices usually start at 0, right? So the even indices would be 0, 2, 4, etc. Because 0 is even, then 1 is odd, 2 even, and so on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what constitutes a vowel. I remember that vowels are a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase. But in this case, we're looking specifically for uppercase vowels. So, the vowels we care about are 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', in uppercase.\n\nSo the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string s.\n2. For each character, check if it's at an even index.\n3. Check if the character is an uppercase vowel.\n4. If both conditions are true, increment the count.\n\nWait, but what's an even index? Let me think. For a string like 'aBCdEf', the indices are 0:a, 1:B, 2:C, 3:d, 4:E, 5:f. So even indices are 0,2,4. The example says the output is 1.

Even indices are 0 and 2. At index 0, it's lowercase 'd' which is not a vowel, and at index 2, it's 'B' which is not a vowel in uppercase (since 'B' is consonant and not an uppercase vowel). So count is 0, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 'abcdefg' returns 0. Let's see, all letters are lowercase. So even though the vowels are present, they are lowercase, so they don't count. Hence, the function counts 0.\n\nSo the function should not consider lowercase vowels as valid.

Then, for those characters, I check if they are vowels and whether they are uppercase. If both conditions are met, I count them.\n\nWait, what's an even index? Well, in programming, indices usually start at 0. So even indices would be 0, 2, 4, etc. So the first character is index 0, third is 2, and so on.\n\nSo first, I need to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, I check if its position is even. If it is, then I check if the character is an uppercase vowel.\n\nWhat's considered a vowel here? Vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and their uppercase counterparts. So both uppercase and lowercase vowels might be present in the string, but the problem says to count uppercase vowels only. So I only count 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.\n\nWait, the examples given: in 'aBCdEf', the output is 1. Let's see. The string is 'aBCdEf', the indices are 0: 'a', 1: 'B', 2: 'C', 3: 'd', 4: 'E', 5: 'f'.

But since the problem specifically says uppercase vowels, I'm only concerned with the uppercase versions. So, I'm looking for 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.\n\nNext, the indices. Wait, in Python, strings are zero-indexed, right? So even indices would be 0, 2, 4, etc. Like, the first character is index 0 (which is even), then index 2, and so on.\n\nSo the plan is: loop through each character in the string, and for each character that's in an even index (0, 2, 4...), check if it's one of the uppercase vowels.

So, first, I should clarify what counts as a vowel. Typically, vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y, but I think in this case, it's only the lowercase ones. But wait, in the context of uppercase vowels, does it refer to the actual uppercase letters A, E, I, O, U?

So, for example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3] and delimeter is 4, the output should be [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]. Hmm, that makes sense. The delimeter is placed between each pair of numbers.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think I can iterate through the list and, for each element except the last one, append the current number followed by the delimeter. Then, after the loop, I need to append the last element without adding another delimeter.\n\nWait, but is there a more efficient way to do this without using append multiple times, which could be inefficient? Maybe using list comprehensions or some kind of zip operation.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in Python, you can modify a list in place by iterating over it with indices.

Each tuple has the row and column indices. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. The 2D list isn't a regular matrix; it can have rows with varying numbers of columns. For example, one row might have 5 elements, another might have 6, and so on. So, each row can have different lengths, which affects the columns index.\n\nFrom the examples given, let's break them down. \n\nIn the first example, lst is a 3-row list. The first row is [1,2,3,4,5,6], which is 6 elements long. The second row is [1,2,3,4,1,6], 6 elements again, and the third row is [1,2,3,4,5,1], which is also 6.

Then, for each row, loop through each element, checking if it equals x. For each matching element, collect the pair (row, col) as a tuple.\n\nBut the problem has two sorting requirements: first, sort by row index in ascending order. Then, within the same row, the column indices should be in descending order.\n\nWait, let me check the example:\n\nIn the first example, the tuples are [(0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0)].\n\nLet me list the 1s:\n\nRow"], "idxs": [99], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [8.874485492706299]}, {"index": 4, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called get_row that takes a nested list and an integer x, and then return a list of tuples.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the input looks like. The input is a 2D data structure, which is similar to a matrix but each row can have a different number of columns. So each sublist in the main list represents a row. For example, in the first sample, the first row has 6 elements, the second also has 6, and the third 6 as well, but their values vary.\n\nThe function is supposed to find all instances of the integer x in this nested list. For each occurrence of x, I need to record the row and column indices, starting from 0. So, for the first sample input, when x is 1, the output is [(0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0)]. Wait, let me check why.\n\nLooking at the first sample:\n\nThe list is [\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n]\n\nSo, x is 1.

So (2,0) and (2,5).\n\nSo all these tuples are collected, then sorted. Now the sorting is a bit tricky. They have to be first sorted by rows in ascending order. So all row 0 come first, then row 1, then row 2. Within the same row, the columns are sorted in descending order. So in row 1, column 4 comes before column 0. Similarly, in row 2, column 5 comes before column 0.\n\nSo, the initial list of tuples after collection is:\n\n[(0,0), (1,0"], "idxs": [89], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.083162307739258]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, so I have to write a Python function called get_row.

Then, I need to return a list of tuples, each tuple being (row, column), sorted first by row in ascending order and within each row, columns sorted in descending order. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, I need to iterate through each sublist in the main list. Each sublist represents a row in the \"matrix,\" but each row can have a different number of elements. For each element in the sublist, I need to check if it equals x. If it does, then I record the (row, column) pair.\n\nWait, but the rows are counted starting from 0? Yes, the problem statement says the coordinates start with 0. So, for a row in the list, the index is the row number. Similarly, for each element in that row, the index is the column number, and the column also starts from 0.\n\nSo, first step is to collect all (row, column) pairs where the element equals x. Let me think about how to loop through the structure.\n\nI can loop over the outer list with their indices as rows. Then, for each row, loop over the inner list with their indices as columns. If the element at that position is x, then add (row, column) to a temporary list or directly to the result list.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should collect all these pairs first, then sort them. That would make sense. So I can create a list called coordinates, and for each occurrence of x in the list, I append (row, column) to coordinates.\n\nOnce I have all the coordinates, I need to sort them. The sorting needs to be done first by the row in ascending order. So, for two tuples (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), compare r1 and r2. If r1 is less than r2, then (r1, c1) comes first. If the rows are equal, then I need to sort the columns in descending order. So for columns, c1 is compared to c2, but in descending, so c2 is larger than c1, then (r1, c1) comes after (r2, c2).\n\nHmm, how do I implement this in Python"], "idxs": [97], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.68441367149353]}, {"index": 6, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called get_row.

For each element in a row, check if it equals x. If it does, I record its position. But wait, how do I track the row and column indices?\n\nSo, each row is a list itself. The index of the row in lst is the row number, starting from 0. Then, within each row, I have to loop through the elements to find x. For each occurrence, the column index can be found using the index() method on the row list.\n\nWait, but the row could have multiple x's, right? So, for each row, I'll loop through each element, and collect all (row, column) pairs where the element is x.\n\nBut also, the hierarchy of sorting is important.

Once all elements are checked, sort the results list. The primary key for sorting is the row index in ascending order. The secondary key is the column index in descending order.\n\nHow to sort with multiple keys? Oh right, when you sort, you can use the key function, and for tuples, it's straightforward. In Python, the sort can be done by specifying the key as a tuple. Since we need row ascending, then column descending, the key would be something like (row, -column), or (-column, row), but wait.\n\nWait, when we do the sorted function, the default is to sort in ascending order.

Each element is either the target x or something else. I need to go through each element in the nested lists and record the position (row, column) where x occurs.\n\nThen, I need to collect all these (row, column) tuples into a list. Once I have that list, I must sort it. The primary sort key is the row number in ascending order. If two elements are in the same row, the secondary sort key is the column number in descending order.

So, for each element in the nested lists, if element == x, then record its position.\n\nWait, but for each row, the columns can have varying lengths. For each row, I can loop through the indices using a range from 0 to len(row)-1, and for each index, check the element. But need to make sure that for rows with zero elements, we don't loop at all.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, in the sample input, a row can be empty, like [ ], [1], [1, 2, 3]. So I have to handle cases where the row has no elements. So for each row, I can loop through all the elements, or perhaps more accurately, loop through all columns up to the length of that particular row.\n\nLet me think with an example.

Then, I need to sort this list first by rows in ascending order and for each row, the columns should be in descending order.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll read the examples given to understand better.\n\nThe first example:\nget_row([\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n], 1) returns [(0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0)]\n\nLooking at this, I see that in each row, the value 1 appears in certain columns.\n\nRow 0: column 0\nRow 1: column 4 and 0\nRow 2: column 5 and 0\n\nSo for each occurrence, we create a tuple (row, column). Then, we sort these tuples by row number ascending. So all row 0s come first, then row 1s, then row 2s.\n\nWithin each row, we sort the columns in descending order. So for row 1, column 4 comes before column 0.

Let's break it down.\n\nThe function is given a 2D data structure, lst, which isn't necessarily rectangular. Each row can have a different number of columns. The task is to find all the tuples (row, column) where the value is x. Then, we need to sort these tuples first by row in ascending order, and within each row, by column in descending order.\n\nLet's look at the examples to make sure I understand what's expected.\n\nIn the first example, the input is a list of three rows. The first row has 6 elements, and the value 1 is at (0,0). The second row has 6 elements, with 1 at (1,4) and (1,0). The third row has 1 at (2,5) and (2,0). The output is a list of tuples sorted first by row, then by column in descending order. So for row 0, the columns are [0], row 1 has columns 4 and 0, so in descending order, 4 comes first, then 0.

If the string is empty, it should return True because an empty string is considered a palindrome. Right, the examples provided include an empty string returning True, so that's a case to handle.\n\nNext, for non-empty strings, I can compare the string to its reverse. If they are the same, then it's a palindrome. How do I reverse a string in Python? Oh, right, s[::-1] gives the reversed string. So, for example, 'aba' reversed is 'aba', which will return True.\n\nSo, the function can be structured as follows:\n\nCheck if the input string equals its reverse. But I should also consider the empty string, which is a corner case. Alternatively, the reverse of the empty string is itself, so when I compare it, the function will correctly return True.\n\nWait, what about the examples? The empty string returns True, which is handled by the same logic. For 'aba', comparing to its reverse will also return True. Same for 'aaaaa'. For 'zbcd', reversing it gives 'dcba', which is not equal, so it returns False.\n\nSo, the function can be as simple as returning text == text[::-1]. No need for any loops or complex methods because the slice operation in Python efficiently reverses the string.\n\nI should also make sure to handle all possible string inputs, including unicode strings, but since the type is str, it's probably handled correctly in Python.\n\nPutting it all together, the function can be written in a single line. But let me check: what if the string is None? But according to the type hints, the input is str, so None is not allowed. So the function is safe.\n\nLet me write the code:\n\nreturn text == text[::-1]\n\nSo, the function will check if the original string is equal to its reverse.

But wait, what about different cases, like if the string has uppercase and lowercase letters? Oh, but in the examples given, like 'aaaaa' and 'zbcd' are all lowercase. So maybe the problem is case-sensitive. Probably, the definitions in the test cases are case-sensitive, so I don't need to handle case insensitivity here.\n\nSo the steps are: take the input string, check if it equals its reverse. If yes, return True; else, False. But wait, what about empty string? Well, an empty string is considered a palindrome, so that's covered.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. For example, a single character returns True. Strings with all same characters.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a palindrome can be checked by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center. So, I can have two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right). I'll compare the characters at these pointers. If they are the same, I move the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left. If at any point the characters don't match, the string isn't a palindrome.\n\nWait, but what about an empty string? Oh right, according to the examples, an empty string returns True.

Initialize two pointers, left at 0 and right at len(text) - 1.\n3. Loop while left is less than or equal to right.\n4. In each iteration, compare text[left] and text[right].\n5.

If they are the same, return True; else, False.\n\nHmm, which approach is more efficient? The two-pointer method might be more efficient in terms of time and space since it doesn't require creating a new reversed string. But for the problem at hand, perhaps using the slicing method is more straightforward and easier to write without risking index errors.\n\nWait, but for very long strings, slicing creates a copy, which might use more memory. But for most purposes, it's negligible, especially in Python. So for simplicity, I think using the reversed approach is better.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Handle empty string.\n- Reverse the string.\n- Compare with original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine all cases into one comparison.

But 'zbcd' isn't because reversing it would be 'dcba', which is different.\n\nFirst, consider the edge cases. The function already has tests for empty string and other examples.

So I'll directly compare the two.\n\nSo the function could look something like this: return text == text[::-1]. That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples provided.\n\n1. For an empty string: text is \"\", reversing it is still \"\". So, \"\" == \"\" is True. That's correct.\n\n2. For 'aba', reversing it gives 'aba', which matches and should return True.\n\n3. For 'aaaaa', reversing it gives 'aaaaa' again. True.\n\n4. For 'zbcd', reversing it gives 'dcbz'. Since 'zbcd' is not equal to 'dcbz', the function returns False. That's correct.\n\nSo, the logic works for all the sample cases. It looks like the entire function can be written in just a few lines.\n\nTherefore, the function code should be:\n\ndef is_palindrome(text: str):\n    return text == text[::-1]\n\nThat's all, right? It's so simple that I think I'm missing something, but based on how the problem is defined, that's exactly what's needed. Let's see, maybe I should also consider the case where text is not a string, but according to the type hints, it's a str, so we don't have to handle that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

How can I reverse a string in Python? Oh right, I can slice it with [::-1], which gives the reversed string.\n\nSo the steps are: take the input string, check if it equals its reversed version. If they are equal, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nWait, let me think about edge cases. For example, the empty string\u2014yes, the function should return True as shown. Another case is a single character string, which is also a palindrome. What about strings with all same characters? Like 'aaaaa' which is a palindrome.\n\nWhat about non-letter characters? Oh, the function treats all characters as part of the palindrome, so it doesn't matter. For example, 'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama' is a palindrome. So my function will handle that correctly because it's just comparing the exact string against its reverse.\n\nPutting it all together, the function can be written in a single line. Or maybe two lines for clarity. Let me see: I can write it as return text == text[::-1]. That should do it.\n\nSo, the function will check if the given text is equal to its reverse. If yes, it's a palindrome; otherwise, it's not. That's straightforward.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might handle it by checking first and last characters moving towards the center. But for the problem, I think the simplest solution is the best, so reversing the entire string and comparing is efficient enough.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as simple as that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward. We can achieve this by comparing the given string to its reverse. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Reverse the String**: Reverse the input string using Python slicing.\n2. **Compare Strings**: Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string.\n3. **Return Result**: If they are equal, the string is a palindrome, so we return True.

Oh right, I can reverse the text and then compare it to the original. But wait, what about edge cases? Like if the string is empty. Oh right, an empty string is considered a palindrome, so the code should return True in that case.\n\nAnother thing to consider is what if the string only has one character? That should also return True since it's a single character, which is a palindrome by definition.\n\nSo the plan is: reverse the string and check if it equals the original. If they are equal, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nHow do I reverse a string in Python? Oh right, there's the[::-1] slicing method. So reversed_text = text[::-1]. This will give me the reversed string.\n\nWait, what about when the text is empty? Let's test that. If text is an empty string, then reversed_text will also be an empty string, so the comparison will be True, which is correct.\n\nWhat about 'aba'? Reversed it would be 'aba' as well, so that's a palindrome.\n\nNow, how to structure the function. The function takes text as a parameter, which is a string. Then, it returns the boolean result of text == text[::-1]. That's simple enough.\n\nSo the function can be written in one line.

For example, a string with letters and numbers. Like 'aabbaa' should return True. Or 'abba' is also a palindrome.\n\nWhat about case sensitivity?

Since it's a small function, it's better to define it inside or as a separate function.\n\nSo, the helper function is_prime(n) should do the following:\n- If n is less than 2, return False.\n- Check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n.

The output should be another string, but only include words whose lengths are prime. For example, in the first example, \"This is a test\" has words with lengths 4, 2, 1, 4.

If any number in this range divides n, it's not prime.\n- Otherwise, it is prime.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the function should return True because 2 is prime.\n\nSo, for each word in the words list, I'll call is_prime on the length. If it is prime, I'll include that word in the result.\n\nNow, how to collect these words? I can loop through each word, check its length, and if it's prime, add it to a new list.\n\nOnce I have this new list, I need to join them into a string separated by spaces.\n\nPutting it all together:\n1.

Likely, I should use text.encode('utf-8') since that's a standard encoding.\n\nOnce I have the hash object, I can update it with the encoded bytes. Or can I pass the bytes directly to hashlib.md5()? I think so. So maybe something like hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest() to get the hexadecimal string.\n\nPutting it all together: if the text is non-empty, compute the MD5, else return None.\n\nLet me structure that. The function will first check if not text, then return None. Else, proceed.\n\nWait, in Python, if text is an empty string, 'if text' will be False. So the condition can be simply: if not text: return None.\n\nThen, encode the text into bytes. Then compute the MD5 and get the hexdigest.\n\nSo, the docstring mentions returning None when the input is empty. The example uses a non-empty string and gives a specific hash, which I can verify.\n\nTesting with 'Hello world' should give that hash. Let me see: I can compute it quickly. Using an online tool or remember that 'Hello world' has a certain MD5.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it here. Let me think: 'Hello world' in bytes is 'Hello world', which is 11 characters. The MD5 is 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62 as per the example. So the code should generate that.\n\nPutting it all together, the code should be something like:\n\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    if not text:"], "idxs": [113], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [9.820701837539673]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called string_to_md5 that takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash as a string.

So I'll need to import hashlib.\n\nThe function is supposed to return the hexadecimal string representation of the MD5 hash. I think hashlib.md5 returns the digest in bytes, so I'll need to convert that to a string. I believe the string representation is typically in hex format, but I should double-check the documentation.\n\nWait, looking at hashlib's md5 method, the digest method can return different types. So using .hexdigest() will give me the hexadecimal string, which is exactly what I need.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. If the input text is an empty string, return None.\n2. Otherwise, calculate the MD5 hash of the text.\n3. Convert the hash to a hexadecimal string.\n4. Return that string.\n\nBut wait, what about the encoding of the text? The md5 function in hashlib requires the input to be in bytes. So I need to encode the text string into bytes. The question is, what encoding to use?

What if text is None? Well, in the problem statement, the function is called with a string, and if it's empty, return None. But if the function gets something else, like None, what happens?

So I'll need to import hashlib.\n\nWait, but in the example, when the input is 'Hello world', the output is a 32-character hexadecimal string. That makes sense because the MD5 hash is 128 bits, which is represented as 32 hex characters.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n1. Check if the input text is empty. If it is, return None.\n2. Use the hashlib library to create a MD5 hash.\n3. Convert the hash object into a hexadecimal string.\n4. Return that string.\n\nWait, what about case sensitivity? MD5 hashes are usually in lowercase, but does it matter? Let me check the example. The expected output is all lowercase, so I should make sure to return lowercase.\n\nSo in the hash part, I'll call md5(text.encode()).hexdigest(). This will give me a lowercase string.\n\nPutting it all together, the function would look like this: check if text is empty, if yes, return None. Otherwise, compute the MD5 hash and return it as a string.\n\nWait, but what about the encoding of the text? Using 'text.encode()' implicitly uses utf-8, which should be fine for most cases.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the function is called sorted_list_sum, but from the description, it seems like the task isn't just summing but also manipulating the list. Wait, but looking at the examples, it's not about sums. Oh, perhaps the function name is a bit misleading. Let me make sure.\n\nThe function should accept a list of strings. It needs to delete the strings that have odd lengths. Then return the resulting list with sorted order based on the length of each word. If two words have the same length, sort them alphabetically. Also, the examples show that all words have the same length, but the function doesn't assume that in the problem statement. Wait, no, the note says: \"You may assume that all words will have the same length.\" So even though the examples have varying lengths, I think the function should process words correctly regardless, but perhaps the note is clarifying that for the purpose of the problem, all words have the same length. Or maybe the note is a red herring. I'll check.\n\nWait, in the examples, the first one is [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"], and the output is [\"aa\"]. So \"aa\" has length 2, \"a\" is 1, \"aaa\" is 3. So all lengths are odd except \"aa\". So the function filters out the ones with odd lengths, then sorts the remaining. In that case, it only keeps \"aa\", which is even length.\n\nThe second example is [\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]. So \"ab\" is 2, \"a\" is 1, \"aaa\" is 3, \"cd\" is 2. So after filtering, \"ab\" and \"cd\" remain. Then, since they have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically: \"ab\" comes before \"cd\". So the output is [\"ab\", \"cd\"].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Filter out the strings with odd lengths.\n2. Sort the remaining strings first by their length in ascending order.\n3. If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically (case by case? Since the examples are lowercase, perhaps case-sensitive).\n4.

Oh, and all the words in the input are of the same length, so I don't have to worry about varying lengths beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, the problem says I should write a function that does this, right? So let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input list. The function is given 'lst', which is a list of strings. I have to go through each string in this list and check if their length is odd. If it is odd, I remove them. So, the first step is to filter out the strings with odd lengths.\n\nHow do I check the length of a string? Well, in Python, each string has a 'len()' function. So for each item in lst, I can do len(item) and see if it's odd. How do I check if a number is odd? I can use modulus, like if len(item) % 2 != 0, then it's odd, so we exclude it.\n\nOnce I have the filtered list containing only strings with even lengths, the next step is to sort them. The sorting should be based on two criteria: first by the length of the strings, in ascending order, and then alphabetically if two strings have the same length.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, I can assume all strings have the same length. So in that case, do I need to sort by length? Or maybe it's a typo. Because if all have the same length, then the primary sorting key is length, but since all are same, the secondary key is alphabetical order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Filter the list to remove strings with odd lengths.\n2. Sort the remaining strings by two keys: first by the length (ascending), then lexographically if lengths are equal.\n\nWait, but if all strings have the same length, then all have the same first key. So the secondary key is the alphabetical order, regardless of original order. So the sorted list is based on their alphabetical order, since their lengths are same.\n\nBut looking back at the examples:\n\nFirst example: [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"] becomes [\"aa\"].

Then, the resulting list needs to be sorted such that the words are ordered by their lengths in ascending order. If two words have the same length, they should be sorted alphabetically.

Let's see, the original list: \"ab\" (2), \"a\" (1), \"aaa\" (3), \"cd\" (2). So deleting the ones with odd lengths, \"a\" and \"aaa\" are removed. So remaining are \"ab\" and \"cd\", both of length 2. Now, they need to be sorted alphabetically. Wait, \"ab\" comes before \"cd\" alphabetically, so the result is [\"ab\", \"cd\"], which matches the example.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [\"ab\", \"cd\"], which suggests that when the lengths are the same, alphabetical order is used, regardless of the initial order in the list.

If the length is even, we keep them; if it's odd, we remove them.\n\n2. **Sort the remaining strings**: The sorting has two criteria.

So in the filtered list, the remaining words might have varying lengths.\n\nBut the problem requires that the sorted list be ordered first by length, then by alphabetical order when lengths are the same.\n\nWait, but if all words were of the same original length, but after filtering, we only keep those with even lengths, then in the resulting list, all remaining words would have the same length.

So first, I should sort by length, then by alphabetical order for ties.\n\nAlright, so after filtering, I can sort the filtered list. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. Filter the input list to include only strings with even lengths.\n2. Sort the resulting list first by length (which is same for all, but necessary for the sort), and then by the string itself alphabetically.\n\nWait, no: For step 2, the primary key for sorting is the length of the strings, and for items with the same length, it's their natural string order (alphabetical). Since the problem states that all words have the same length after filtering, the resulting list will have all strings with the same length, so the sorting may just be by the string lex order. But to make it general, I should just sort by both.\n\nSo how do I implement that in Python? The sorted function allows a key function. For each string s, the key can be a tuple: ("], "idxs": [106], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [9.317862272262573]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called sorted_list_sum.

The goal is to delete the strings that have odd lengths and then return the resulting list sorted in a specific way. \n\nFirst, I should filter out the strings with odd lengths. So I'll need to iterate through each string in the list and check if the length is odd. If it is, I skip it; otherwise, I keep it. \n\nOnce I have the filtered list, I need to sort it. The sorting should be based on two criteria: first, by the length of the words in ascending order. If two words have the same length, then I sort them alphabetically in ascending order as well.\n\nWait, the problem statement says to delete strings with odd lengths. So I'll create a new list that includes only the even-length strings. Then, I'll sort this new list.\n\nHow do I sort the list with those criteria? I can use the sorted() function with a custom key. The primary key for sorting will be the length of the strings, and the secondary key will be the string itself (since when two lengths are equal, the alphabetical order is required).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Filter the list to include only even-length strings.\n2. Sort the filtered list: first by length, then alphabetically.\n\nWait, let me think about the sorting order. For the same length, they should be sorted alphabetically. So for example, if two strings have the same length, say \"apple\" and \"banana\", wait no, that's a different length example. Let me think of another example: \"ab\", \"cd\". Both have length 2, so in alphabetical order, it should be [\"ab\", \"cd\"], which is the example given.\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"aa\"]. \"a\" has length 1 (odd, so it's removed), \"aa\" has length 2, so the sorted list is [\"aa\"]. Wait, but the first example in the problem says that [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"] returns [\"aa\"]. But wait, \"a\" has length 1, so it's removed, and \"aa\" has length 2, \"aaa\" has length 3 (odd, removed), so the resulting list is just [\"aa\"], which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, [\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"], after removing the odd lengths, \"a\" and"], "idxs": [92], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [8.27580213546753]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Okay, I need to write a Python function called sorted_list_sum that takes a list of strings as input.

Also, the function should return a list of strings in this sorted order.\n\nLet me break down what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to filter the list to remove any strings that have an odd length. So for each string in the input list, I check if its length is even. If it is, keep it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nOnce I have the filtered list containing only even-length strings, I need to sort this list. The sorting criteria are two-fold: first by the length of the strings in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, then they should be sorted alphabetically in ascending order.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: \"You may assume that all words will have the same length.\" Hmm, does that mean in all the test cases, every string in the input list has the same length? That would change things because then I don't need to sort based on length, only alphabetically after ensuring they're even-length.\n\nWait no, the note says \"You may assume that all words will have the same length.\" So perhaps, regardless of their individual lengths, but in the function, we need to select those with even lengths, and then return them sorted by length (which all are same) and alphabetically.\n\nWait, no, the note is saying that in the input list, all the words have the same length. So that simplifies it a bit because after filtering, all remaining strings have the same length (even), and thus when sorted, it's only about the alphabetical order.\n\nWait, but the initial example: [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"].\n\nWait in that example, \"aa\" has length 2, \"a\" has length 1, which is odd, so removed. \"aaa\" is length 3, which is odd, so removed. So the result is [\"aa\"], which is just one element.\n\nSecond example: [\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]. \"ab\" is 2, kept. \"a\" is length 1, removed. \"aaa\" is 3, removed. \"cd\" is 2, kept.

For the first part, the key can be the length of each string. But when multiple strings have the same length, I need to sort them alphabetically, which is the default behavior of sorted when two items compare equal in the primary key.\n\nWait, no. The default sorted is in ascending order based on the natural ordering, which for strings is lexicographical. So, if the lengths are the same, the sorted function will arrange them alphabetically. So, the key function can be a tuple where the first element is the length, and the second is the string itself to ensure alphabetical order when lengths are same.\n\nWait, no. Because if I just do sorted with key=lambda x: (len(x), x), then when lengths are same, the secondary key is the string itself, which will sort them alphabetically.

So for example, in [2,3,4,1,2,4], possible subarrays are [2], [2,3], [2,3,4], etc.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum sum, so I need to check all possible subarrays and find the one with the smallest sum.

The second example, [-1,-2,-3], the sum is -6, which is the sum of all elements. So sometimes, the minimum isn\u2019t a single element but a combination. Also, if the array has all negatives, the minimum sum might be the entire array.\n\nHmm. So I can't just consider single elements. I need to find the earliest point where adding elements could lead to a lower sum. Like, perhaps using a sliding window technique.\n\nAnother approach: keep track of the current sum as I iterate through the array. For each position, add the element to the current sum and see if it's the minimum so far. Then, reset the current sum if adding the next element would make it larger than necessary. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we're looking for a contiguous subarray, maybe the minimum is somewhere within a window where the sum is decreasing as you add elements. That is, once the current sum becomes more than the current minimum, we can stop adding elements to the window.\n\nWait, no. Because it's possible that a longer subarray could have a smaller sum. For example, in [-1, 2, 3], the minimum is -1, but if we take [ -1, 2, 3], the sum is 4 which is higher.

So, for each possible starting index, I need to look at all possible contiguous slices to their respective ends. But checking every possible subarray sounds inefficient, especially for larger arrays.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to do this without checking every subarray. Like, perhaps using some kind of running sum or tracking the minimum as we go.\n\nLet me consider the example [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]. The minimum subarray sum here is 1, which corresponds to just the subarray [1]. So, the approach should find that single 1.\n\nAnother example is [-1, -2, -3], where the minimum is -6, which is the sum of the entire array. So, sometimes, the minimum comes from adding up elements, not just a single element.\n\nHmm, so the minimum could be any subarray, from a single element to the entire array. How can I efficiently find this?\n\nOne approach is to calculate the sum for every possible subarray starting from each index. That is, for each i starting at 0, keep a running sum as we add elements from i onwards. Keep track of the minimum sum found so far.\n\nSo, for the array, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- Initialize current_sum to 0\n- For j from i to n-1:\n   - current_sum += nums[j]\n   - if current_sum is less than current_min, update current_min\n\nThis way, for each starting index i, we consider all possible subarrays starting at i and ending at j (where j >= i). We add each element to current_sum as we go, and track the minimum.\n\nBut wait, is this approach efficient enough? For an array of length n, this would be O(n^2) time. For small arrays, that's fine.

For example, if the input is [2,3,4,1,2,4], the output is 1 because there's a subarray that sums to 1. Another example is [-1,-2,-3], which sums to -6, and that's the answer.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array, unlike a subsequence which can have non-contiguous elements. So any consecutive elements in the list can form a subarray.\n\nMy initial thought is to consider all possible subarrays, calculate their sums, and find the minimum among them. But wait, the problem is that if I naively check every possible subarray, the time complexity will be O(n^2), which might be acceptable if n isn't too large, but I wonder if there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the brute-force method first to figure out the correct sum. Then maybe I can optimize it.\n\nSo for each starting index i, I can compute the sum of elements starting from i to j, where j starts from i and goes up to the end. For each i, I'll keep adding the next element until j is at the end of the array.

Oh right, because negative numbers can make the sum as small as possible, even if earlier parts of the array have larger sums.\n\nLet me consider the example given: [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]. The minimum sum is 1, which is the subarray [1]. But wait, how about a negative array, like the second example: [-1, -2, -3]. It returns -6, which is the sum of the entire array, but wait, isn't the smallest possible sum even lower? No, wait, the sum of the entire array in this case is -6, and that's the minimum because any subarray would have a sum less than or equal to it.

Or perhaps it's supposed to find the second smallest overall, even if there are duplicates.\n\nWait, the problem statement says to return the 2nd smallest element of the list. So the first example returns 2 as the second element in the sorted list. But in the second example, the list is [5,1,4,3,2], when sorted, it becomes [1,2,3,4,5], so the second element is 2.

For [1,1], it returns None because there's only one unique smallest element, or because there's only one element in total?\n\nWait, the examples show that for [1,1], the function returns None. So that suggests that if the list has only one element or all elements are the same, the function returns None because there's no second smallest. So it's expecting the second smallest *distinct* element, not just the second element after sorting.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again.

The function is called next_smallest and it should return the second smallest element, or None if there isn't one.

Given a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the function should return 2, which is the second smallest element. Another example, [5, 1, 4, 3, 2] should return 2 as well, because when sorted, it's [1,2,3,4,5], so the second element is 2.\n\nBut wait, there are edge cases. For example, if the list is empty, we return None. Also, if the list has only one element, or all elements are the same, we should return None. Because, in the case of [1,1], there's no second distinct smallest element.\n\nSo, the plan is: I need to find the second smallest unique element in the list.\n\nHow to do this? Well, the first step is to sort the list. But sorting in what way? Because when the list is sorted, the first two unique elements would be the candidates. However, if there are duplicates, we might need to skip over them.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the examples. Let's take the example from the problem: [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]. When we sort it, it becomes [1,2,3,4,5]. The second element is 2, so that's correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,1]. When sorted, it becomes [1,1]. There's only one unique element, so the next_smallest should be None.\n\nSo, how to approach this algorithm:\n\n1. Convert the list into a sorted list.\n2. Then, iterate through the sorted list to find the second smallest distinct element.\n3. If there are less than two distinct elements, return None.\n4. Otherwise, return the second one.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose the list has multiple same elements but more than one distinct. Like [1,2,2,3], the next smallest after 1 is 2.

The goal is to return the number of times the substring is found in the original string, considering overlapping occurrences.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- When the string is '' and the substring is 'a', it returns 0.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo the function takes two arguments: string and substring, both of type str. And it should return an integer. The examples given are helpful. For instance, when the substring is 'a' in the string 'aaa', it returns 3. That makes sense because each position has an 'a' and they overlap. Similarly, 'aaaa' with substring 'aa' gives 3, not 4. Oh right, because the substring is two characters long, so 'aa' can be found starting at positions 0, 1, and 2, but not again at 3 because the string ends there.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: 'aaaa' has four 'a's. Substring is 'aa'. The first occurrence is at index 0, then 1, then 2. That's three times, because from index 3, 'aa' wouldn't fit as the string is only four characters. So the count is 3.\n\nSo the function should find all possible overlapping occurrences. How do I do that in Python?\n\nI remember that the string method count() counts non-overlapping occurrences. So using that directly won't handle overlapping cases.

The string can be from 0 to len(string) - len(substring), inclusive, because we can't have overshooting.\n\nSo the loop would go from i=0 to i <= (len(string) - len(substring)). For each i, check string[i:i+len(substring)] and see if it equals the substring.\n\nWait, but what if the substring is empty? Oh, but looking at the first example, if the substring is empty, any string will have it infinitely, but in the code, it returns 0.

My goal is to find all occurrences of the substring within the original string, including overlapping ones. \n\nLet me look at the examples provided. \n\nThe first example: how_many_times('', 'a') returns 0. That makes sense because the empty string doesn't contain the substring 'a' at all.\n\nThe second example: how_many_times('aaa', 'a') should return 3. Let me think; in 'aaa', the 'a' appears three times. So, if I just search normally, each single 'a' is counted. But wait, maybe overlapping is when we have substrings overlapping. Oh, wait, no\u2014in this case, every single character is a match, so it's three times.\n\nThe third example is how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') which should return 3.

That makes sense because each 'a' is a match, and they are non-overlapping? Wait, no\u2014wait, it's counting all possible matches, even overlapping ones.

But the problem here specifies that overlapping cases should be counted, so the default count() won't work by itself.\n\nWait, how do you count overlapping occurrences? Let's take the sample input to understand. For example, when the input is 'aaaa' and the substring is 'aa', the output should be 3. Let me see why: the positions are 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3, so three times.\n\nBut if I use the count method,  'aaaa'.count('aa') returns 2, which is less than 3. So the count method doesn't account for overlapping.\n\nSo, I need a different approach. Maybe I can iterate through the string and find each occurrence, then skip over the part of the substring that was just found so that the next search starts right after the end of this occurrence. But wait, that might prevent counting overlapping sequences. Or maybe not?\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to slide a window of the substring's length over the original string. For each possible window, check if it matches the substring and count it if it does.\n\nSo, let's think about that. The length of the substring is len_sub. I can loop from 0 to len(string) - len_sub, so that each window starts at i and ends at i + len_sub -1. For each i, check if the substring starting at i matches the given substring. If yes, increment the count.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each possible starting position, regardless of previous matches, it can find the next occurrence, potentially overlapping.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.

That makes sense because there's nothing to find.\n\nAnother example is when the string is 'aaa' and the substring is 'a', which returns 3. That means each 'a' is counted individually, even though they overlap. So each occurrence is counted as it's found, not as a continuous block.\n\nThen, for 'aaaa' and 'aa', the function returns 3.

Let me see the sample:\n\nSample Output for Jupiter to Neptune is (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\"). Wait, but the order of the planets is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nSo in between Jupiter and Neptune, we have Saturn and Uranus. So the planets between them are Saturn and Uranus, and the output is these two, sorted by proximity to the Sun. But looking at the order, after Jupiter comes Saturn, then Uranus, then Neptune. So the function's output is Saturn first because it's closer to the Sun than Uranus.\n\nWait no, that's not how the sample is. The sample says Jupiter to Neptune returns Saturn and Uranus, but let's check the sample again.\n\nIn the sample, Jupiter and Neptune, the function returns (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\")."], "idxs": [116], "new_tokens": [517], "wall_time": [10.095050811767578]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see what it's about. The task is to write a Python function called bf that takes two planet names as strings, planet1 and planet2. The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and planet2, sorted by their proximity to the Sun. Hmm, wait, but the function should return an empty tuple if either planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to identify the order of the planets in our solar system from the Sun outwards. The description says: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So the order is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Wait, wait, no\u2014the description says \"the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\" So the correct order is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So the planets are in that specific order.\n\nNext, I need to determine for given planet1 and planet2, which planets are between them. But how? Because planet1 could be earlier or later in the sequence than planet2. So first, I should assign each planet a position number based on their order. For example, Mercury is 0, Venus is 1, Earth is 2, Mars is 3, Jupiter is 4, Saturn is 5, Uranus is 6, Neptune is 7. That way, I can compare their positions numerically.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure that the input planet1 and planet2 are valid planet names. If either of them is invalid, return an empty tuple. So the first step is to check if both planet1 and planet2 are in the list of the correct planet names. The names should be case-sensitive, right? Because the examples show \"Mercury\" and \"Jupiter\" with uppercase first letters. So I think the input has to exactly match the correct name in terms of case and spelling. So I'll create a list of valid planet names and check if both planet1 and planet2 are in that list.\n\nWait, the problem says: 'return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.' So I need to have a list of the correct planet names. Let's define the planets in order and then create a tuple or list"], "idxs": [94], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [8.333971738815308]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called bf that takes two planet names and returns a tuple of planets whose orbits are between them, sorted by proximity to the sun. If either planet is invalid, return an empty tuple. \n\nFirst, I should figure out what the correct order of planets is. According to the description, the order from closest to the sun to outermost is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So I'll create a list in that order to represent their positions.\n\nNext, I need to check if both planet1 and planet2 are valid. The function should return an empty tuple if any of them are invalid. So I'll create a variable called planet_order which is a list of planet names in order. Then, I'll check if both planet1 and planet2 are in this list. If either isn't, return empty.\n\nIf both are valid, then I need to determine the range of orbits between them. But the problem is, planet2 could be either after or before planet1 in the order. So first, I'll find their indices. For example, if planet1 is Mercury (index 0) and planet2 is Jupiter (index 4), the planets in between are Venus, Earth, Mars.\n\nWait, no, because the function is looking for orbits between planet1 and planet2. So it depends on which comes first. Wait, the examples show that when Jupiter is first and Neptune is second, the result is Saturn and Uranus. So I think the approach is to find the range that lies between the two planets, regardless of which is first in terms of their order.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to always arrange planet1 and planet2 based on their order in the list and then find the subset of planets that is in the middle. So we can find the indices of both planets, then see which one is earlier (closer to the sun). Suppose planet1 is at index i and planet2 is at index j. Then, the start of the range is the minimum of i and j, and the end is the maximum of i and j. Then, the planets between them would be from start+1 to end-1.\n\nWait, no.

The problem statement says the order is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So I'll create a list like this: ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'].\n\nNext, I need to find the positions of planet1 and planet2 in this list. If either planet is not in the list, I return an empty tuple.\n\nOnce I have their indices, I can determine the range of planets between them. But wait, if planet1 is after planet2 in the list, like in the example where Mercury is given first (which would be index 0) and Uranus is given second (index 6). Wait, no, in that example, the function bf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\") returns planets between Mercury and Uranus. Wait, no, the sample input for the third example is bf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\") and returns (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\"). So Mercury is index 0, Uranus is index 6.

So if planet1 is farther than planet2, the between planets would be in reverse? Or should I always take the planets between the two, ordering by the list?\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the indices of both planets in the ordered list, and then return the list of planets that are in between them, but only in the correct order based on their positions relative to each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the planets as forming a loop around the Sun, so the function should consider that the orbit of"], "idxs": [111], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [9.634979963302612]}], "tstamp": 1755906050.433197}
