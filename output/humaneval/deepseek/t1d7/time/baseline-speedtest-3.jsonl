So, perhaps I can create a generator expression that checks if each number is below t. Then, return all of those being True.\n\nLike, for each num in l, return True if num < t, else False.

The note says that a \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space.

Or should both be removed regardless of case? Well, the examples show that in the test case 'aaBAA', the output is 'B'. So that means the function is case-insensitive; it's removing both lower and upper case vowels.\n\nWait, let me look at the example again. The example given is remove_vowels('aaBAA') returns 'B'. So the function removed 'aaaa' (the first four a's) and only kept 'B'. So yes, both lowercase and uppercase vowels are being removed.

Or maybe, I can loop through each character in the input string and check if it is a vowel. But since checking against a set is more efficient, maybe I should make a set containing {'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'i', 'I', 'o', 'O', 'u', 'U'}, and then for each character in the input, if it's not in this set, I add it to the result.\n\nAnother approach is to create a translation table, using the str.translate() method.

The string \"abAB\" has characters 'a', 'b', 'A', 'B'. The uppercase letters are 'A' and 'B'. The ASCII codes for 'A' is 65 and for 'B' is 66. Adding those gives 65 + 66 = 131.

I can use the isupper() method for strings. That method returns True if the string is uppercase and the string has at least one character.

The first example is \"Hi, my name is John\" which becomes [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]. I notice that the comma after \"Hi\" is removed, and the rest of the words are separated by spaces.

So I'm looking for the largest number less than n that divides it evenly.\n\nFirst, what's the largest possible divisor of n that's smaller than n?

If there are no whitespaces in the text, it should then look for commas to split on.\n\nWait, the problem says if there are no whitespaces, split on commas.

So for example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. If a character is 'z', adding 5 would go past 'z', so it wraps around to the beginning. For instance, 'z' becomes 'e'. \n\nTo decode it, I need to shift each character back by 5 places. So, for 'f', subtracting 5 should get us back to 'a'. But I have to handle cases where shifting back might go below 'a', so again, there's a wrap around involved.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the encoded character is 'e'.

For example, 'abc' becomes 'bca', because it's taking the last character and putting it in front.

Then, return the sum of all entries.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I'll probably need to loop through each element in the list along with their indices. For each element, I check the index to see which case it falls into.\n\nSo, for each index i and element x in the list:\n\n1. If i is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 4: then x becomes x squared.\n2. Else if i is a multiple of 4: then x becomes x cubed.\n3. Else: x stays the same.\n\nWait, but what if an index is a multiple of both 3 and 4? Like 12, which is a multiple of 3 and 4. According to the first condition, since it's a multiple of 3, it would be squared, not cubed. Even though it's also a multiple of 4, the first condition takes precedence. So, the order of checking matters here.\n\nSo the conditions should be checked in the order of 3 first, then 4 but ensuring that 4 is not also a multiple of 3. Wait, actually, the problem statement says if the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. So, in that case, for indexes where i is a multiple of both 3 and 4, we don't compute the cube because they are multiples of 3. So, the priority is to check for multiple of 3 first.\n\nSo the logic should be:\n\n- For each index i:\n   - if i mod 3 == 0 and i mod 4 != 0: square the element\n   - else if i mod 4 == 0: cube the element\n   - else: do nothing\n\nWait, no. Because, if the index is a multiple of both 3 and 4 (like 12), then i mod 3 is 0, so it would be squared, not"], "idxs": [512], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [33.00426983833313]}], "tstamp": 1755840314.821551}

For n >=4, each term is the sum of the previous four terms. So, for example, fib4(4) would be fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) + fib4(0) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.

So for each element in the list of strings, I need to see if the substring is a part of it.\n\nWait, but how do I loop through each string in the list? Oh right, I can use a list comprehension.

So the return line would be something like [s for s in strings if substring in s].\n\nI should also test this logic with the examples. The first example, an empty list, should remain empty. The second example is a list ['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], and substring 'a'. The result should be the first three elements because the fourth, 'cde', doesn't contain 'a'.

I remember from geometry that a right-angled triangle has one angle of exactly 90 degrees. The Pythagorean theorem comes into play here.

Maybe I should create an empty list to store the factors. Then start with the smallest prime, which is 2. I'll check if 2 divides n. If it does, I'll add 2 to the list and divide n by 2, then repeat until it's no longer divisible by 2. Then move on to the next possible prime, which would be 3, and so on.\n\nWait, but how do I know when to stop? The maximum possible factor would be the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root. But since we're listing factors in order, we can iterate up to the square root of n.\n\nWait, not exactly. Suppose n is a prime number itself. Then it would have only itself as a factor, so in that case, I should check all the way up to n. Hmm, maybe it's better to check up to the square root of n, and if after that n is still greater than 1, add that as a factor.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list for the factors.\n2. Start with the smallest prime, 2. While n is divisible by 2, add 2 to the factors list and divide n by 2.\n3. Then check the next number, 3. While n is divisible by 3, add 3 to the factors and divide n by 3.\n4. Continue this process with 5, 7, etc., up to sqrt(n).\n5. After checking all numbers up to sqrt(n), if n is still greater than 1, that means it's a prime number itself, so add it to the factors.\n\nWait, but how do I get the next number to check?

That means every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and at no point does the number of closing parentheses exceed the opening ones as we read from left to right.\n\nSo, how can I approach this?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about the Balance condition.

If at any point a closing bracket doesn't match the top, or if the stack isn't empty after processing all characters, then the brackets are incorrect.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character:\n   a. If it's '<', push it to the stack.\n   b. If it's '>', check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False because there's no corresponding '<'.\n   c. If it's a '>', pop the top and check if it's '<'. If not, return False.\n4. After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True; else, False.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the number of opening and closing brackets might not be balanced? Like the sample input \"><<\" would have:\n- The first '>' has nothing in stack \u2192 return False immediately.\n\nAnother example, \"<<><>>\": Let's process each step.\nStack starts empty.\nFirst '<' \u2192 stack becomes ['<']\nSecond '<' \u2192 stack becomes ['<', '<']\nThird '>' \u2192 pop top, which is '<', which matches, stack now ['<']\nFourth '>' \u2192 pop top, which is '<', which matches, stack becomes empty.\nAfter all, stack is empty \u2192 return True.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nLet me consider possible edge cases:\n- Empty string: But the problem says brackets is a string of \"<\" and \">\", but didn't specify if it's non-empty. If it's empty, according to the first test case, it's False because there's an opening without a closing. Wait, no, wait. The first test case is \"<\" \u2192 which returns False, because the opening has no closing. So empty string would return True? Or perhaps the function is intended to have balanced brackets, so empty is considered correct?\n\nWait, looking"], "idxs": [512], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [32.978527784347534]}], "tstamp": 1755841041.4122941}

First, I need to take the first k elements of the array. Then, from these elements, I include only those with one or two digits. Finally, I sum them up and return that sum.\n\nWait, right. For example, in the example given, arr is [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], and k is 4. So the first four elements are 111, 21, 3, 4000.

If n is even, the next level uses even numbers.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. Oh right, the first level has n stones. Then, the next level's number of stones is determined based on whether the previous level's count was odd or even. So, each time, we alternatively choose the next odd or even number.

The goal is to determine if multiplying these two fractions results in a whole number, meaning the product has an integer value with no fractional part. If it does, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how to parse each fraction into its numerator and denominator. Each fraction is given as a string in the format \"numerator/denominator\". So, I can split each string on the '/' to get the numerator and denominator as separate parts. For example, if x is \"1/5\", splitting it gives [\"1\", \"5\"].\n\nOnce I have the numerators and denominators as integers, I can compute the product of the two fractions. When you multiply two fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, (x_num * n_num) / (x_den * n_den) is the product.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if this product is an integer. That means the numerator after multiplication must be exactly divisible by the denominator. So, I need to compute the product and then check if the denominator divides the numerator evenly.\n\nHmm, but sometimes the product of the fractions can be simplified, so maybe before multiplying, I should simplify each fraction by reducing them to their lowest terms first. But actually, in this case, it doesn't matter because multiplication is commutative and associative.

Let me take a deep breath and think about what needs to be done here.\n\nSo, from the problem statement, the find_zero function takes a list of coefficients xs, which corresponds to a polynomial. The function needs to find a zero point x such that when we evaluate the polynomial at x, the result is zero. It should return only one zero, even if there are multiple. Also, the user mentioned something about the list xs having an even number of coefficients with the largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution. Hmm, okay.\n\nLooking at the examples, when the coefficients are [1,2], which is a linear polynomial 1 + 2x, the zero is at x = -0.5. That makes sense because solving 1 + 2x = 0 gives x = -0.5. The second example is a cubic polynomial with coefficients [-6, 11, -6, 1], which factors as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). The real roots are 1, 2, and 3. The function returns 1.0. But why does it choose 1.0? Maybe because of the way the polynomial is structured or perhaps it's designed to return the largest root? I need to see how the function should behave.\n\nLet me read the docstring again: it says find_zero should find x such that poly(x) = 0. It returns only one zero point. Moreover, it states that xs must have an even number of coefficients, and the largest non-zero coefficient is guaranteed to provide a solution. Hmm, that's interesting. So maybe the function is using some method that's related to the coefficients' particular property, but I'm not exactly sure yet.\n\nLooking at the code, we have the poly function already defined using a list comprehension. The poly function calculates the sum of each coefficient multiplied by x raised to the power of their index. So, for xs = [a0, a1, a2, ..., an], the polynomial is a0 + a1x + a2x^2 + ... + anx^n. So, it's straightforward.\n\nNow, the find_zero function needs to find a root of this polynomial. One method to find roots is using the Newton-Raphson method.

So the steps are: first, calculate the mean of the list. Then, for each number, subtract the mean and take the absolute value of that difference. Finally, average all those absolute differences. Right.\n\nBut how do I calculate the mean in Python? Oh, right, I can sum all the numbers and then divide by the number of elements. So sum(numbers) divided by len(numbers) gives me the mean.\n\nOnce I have the mean, I need to iterate through each number in the list, subtract the mean from it, take the absolute value, and then sum all those values. After that, I divide the total sum by the number of elements again to get the average.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty? Oh, but in the problem statement, it's given as a list of floats.

The standard symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, each representing specific values. But since the number is limited to 1000, the maximum symbol we'll need is M, which stands for 1000.\n\nWait, the examples show outputs like 'xix' (19), 'clii' (152), and 'cdxxvi' (426).

So the function needs to handle numbers from 1 up to and including 1000.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by using a list or a dictionary that maps each Roman numeral value to its symbol. Each symbol corresponds to a specific value. For example, 1 is I, 5 is V, 10 is X, and so on, up to 1000 as M.\n\nSo perhaps I can create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman numeral symbol.

Let's see, the function is already defined with the type hinting, so I just need to fill in the body.\n\nFirst, I should think about the base cases. If the list is empty, the function should return an empty string. That's straightforward because the example shows that concatenate([]) returns an empty string.\n\nNow, for a non-empty list, I need to loop through each string in the list and concatenate them. How do I do that in Python? Oh right, I can use a for loop, but perhaps a more efficient way is to use the join method.\n\nWait, but what if the list contains empty strings? Well, join will just ignore them, which is correct behavior because in the examples, when the list isn't empty, it's just adding the characters in order.\n\nSo the plan is: check if the list is empty. If not, join all the strings in the list and return the result. Alternatively, since joining an empty list returns an empty string, I can just return ''.join(strings) regardless. But the examples show that when the list is empty, it returns an empty string, and when it's ['a', 'b', 'c'], it returns 'abc'. So using the join method directly would handle all cases.\n\nPutting it all together, the function can be as simple as returning the join of the list. But wait, I need to make sure that all elements of the list are strings. The type hint says List[str], so that's guaranteed.\n\nSo the implementation is to return the concatenated string, which is ''.join(strings).\n\nI can also write it without the join if I use a loop. For example, initialize an empty string, then loop through each string in the list and append or add it. But using join is much cleaner and efficient.\n\nSo the complete function is:\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n    return ''.join(strings)\n\nI should test this with the given examples. If the list is empty, it returns an empty string. If it's ['a', 'b', 'c'], it returns 'abc'.

Hmm, let's think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember what the Collatz sequence is. Starting with n, each subsequent term is defined as follows: if the previous term is even, divide by two; if it's odd, multiply by three and add one. The sequence continues until it reaches 1.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. So, I need to generate the sequence, collect all the odd numbers along the way, and then sort that list.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For n=5, the Collatz sequence is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. The odd numbers here are 5 and 1. So the function returns [1,5]. That's already sorted, so maybe the list in the function sometimes comes in reverse order depending on where the numbers are collected.\n\nSo the approach is to generate each term in the Collatz sequence, check if it's odd, and collect those numbers. But how do I make sure I collect them as they appear in the sequence?\n\nWait, but in the example, the function returns 1 and 5, but in the sequence, 5 comes first. So the order in which they are collected isn't strictly in the order of occurrence since the list after 5 generates more even numbers and then comes down to 1. So, the collected odds would be 5 and 1, but the function returns them as [1,5], which is sorted.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Initialize a list to collect the odd numbers.\n2. Start with n and generate the next term using the Collatz rules.\n3. For each term, check if it's odd. If yes, add it to the list.\n4. Continue until the term is 1.\n5.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 121 or 1331 are palindromes because they remain the same when their digits are reversed.\n\nSo the approach is to generate all palindromic numbers up to n and then count how many of them are even and how many are odd.\n\nWait, but generating all palindromes might be more efficient than checking each number from 1 to n. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternative approach: iterate through each number from 1 to n, check if it's a palindrome, and if so, determine if it's even or odd, then count accordingly.\n\nYes, that might be straightforward. Especially since n is up to 10^3, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize two counters: even_count and odd_count, both set to 0.\n\n2.

For positive numbers, round up; for negative, round down. That way, 14.5 becomes 15, -14.5 becomes -15.\n4. Otherwise, just return the rounded integer.\n\nWait, but how do I check if it's exactly halfway? Maybe by looking at the decimal part. So, taking the float, subtracting its integer part, and checking if it's 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using rounding functions but then overriding the 0.5 case.\n\nBut careful with floating point precision. Sometimes, numbers might not be exact, so using == 0.5 could be problematic. Maybe using a small epsilon to compare? Hmm, but I think for the purposes of this problem and given that the input is a string, it's safe to assume that if the decimal is .5, it's intended.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nConvert the string to float: value = float(value_str)\n\nThen, calculate the fractional part: fractional = value - int(value)\n\nIf fractional is 0.5, then round away from zero:\n- If value is positive, round up.\n- If value is negative, round down.\n\nBut wait, how do I determine the direction.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, I'll check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it's uppercase, I'll convert it to lowercase. If it's lowercase, I'll convert it to uppercase.\n\nWait, how do I check if a character is uppercase or lowercase in Python? Oh right, using the isupper() and islower() methods. So for each character c in the string, I can do something like: if c.isupper(), then c.lower(), else c.upper().\n\nI can create a new string by appending each transformed character to it. So I'll initialize an empty string, maybe call it result, and loop through each character in the input string. For each character, process it and add it to result.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\ndef flip_case(string: str) -> str:\n    result = \"\"\n    for c in string:\n        if c.isupper():\n            result += c.lower()\n        else:\n            result += c.upper()\n    return result\n\nWait, but what about non-alphabetic characters? Like numbers or symbols. The problem statement says it's for a given string, but the example only includes letters. So does it matter? Probably, but if a character is not a letter, it shouldn't change. But in the code above, if c.isupper() is false, whether it's a letter or not, it will call c.upper(), which might actually change some symbols or numbers? Wait, no. Because for numbers, c.isupper() is False, so it will try to convert it to upper(), but numbers don't have case. Similarly, symbols like '@' or '#', c.isupper() is False, but c.upper() leaves them unchanged.\n\nSo the code as written is safe even for non-letters, because non-letters will remain the same.\n\nTesting that logic, for example, if input is 'Hello123!', the function would flip H to h, e to E, l to L, L to l, o to O, 1 stays 1, 2 stays 2, 3 stays 3, and ! stays !.

Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, each row in the grid represents a well. And each 1 in a row means a unit of water. Each well has a bucket that can hold a certain capacity. The goal is to figure out how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty all these wells.\n\nHmm, looking at the examples might help. In Example 1, the grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and the bucket capacity is 1. The output is 6. Let's think about why.\n\nEach bucket can carry up to 1 unit. The first row has 1 unit, so it would need one bucket lowering. The second row has one 1. The third row has four 1s. So for each potential bucket, how do we calculate the number of times they have to go down.\n\nWait, maybe each row's 1s contribute to the total number of times the buckets are lowered. But I think it's more about the maximum number of 1s in any column. Because when you lower the buckets, you can take as much as the capacity allows from each column.\n\nAh, right! The number of operations is not per row but per column. Because each column represents all the wells in that column across all rows. So for each column, the number of times you need to lower the bucket is equal to the number of 1s in that column divided by the bucket's capacity, and then take the ceiling of that (since any fraction of a bucket will require an additional lowering).\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you lower a bucket, it can take multiple units from different rows in the same column at once, up to the bucket's capacity.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the grid is 3 rows and 4 columns.

So, for example, if numbers is [1, 2, 3] and delimeter is 4, the result should be [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]. Hmm, how does that work? Between 1 and 2, we insert 4, and between 2 and 3, we insert another 4.

For example, if numbers is empty, the function should return an empty list. Similarly, if numbers has just one element, after inserting the delimeter, it should just have that element followed by nothing because there are no pairs left.\n\nI think the approach is to loop through the numbers and insert the delimeter after each element except the last one. So, for each element in the list, except the last, we add the current element and then the delimeter.

So the empty string is considered a palindrome, which makes sense because it doesn't have any characters to compare.\n\nHow can I check if a string is a palindrome? One straightforward way is to compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, then it's a palindrome.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. The function can return text == text[::-1]. This uses slicing in Python where [::-1] reverses the string. If the original string is equal to the reversed one, it's a palindrome.\n\nWait, but what about strings with different data types? Oh, the input is specified as a str, so that's not an issue.\n\nLet me test this logic with examples. For 'aba', reversing gives 'aba', so it's a palindrome. For 'zbcd', reversing gives 'dcba', which is different, so returns False. What about the empty string? text[::-1] is still an empty string, so it returns True, which is correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases? Like a single character, like 'a'?

That makes sense, because in the first sample, [1,2,3,4,5], the function returns 2, which is the second smallest, and in the second sample [5,1,4,3,2], when sorted it's [1,2,3,4,5], so second is 2.\n\nBut then, if the list is [1,1,2,3], the second smallest is 1 again, because the second occurrence of 1 comes before 2. So perhaps the initial approach is to just sort the list and then check if the second element is different from the first. If it is, return the second, else check if there's any element beyond that that's larger. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no. The function is supposed to return the second"], "idxs": [512], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [33.01233267784119]}], "tstamp": 1755842494.5869668}

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the count method in Python counts non-overlapping occurrences. But here, the problem says to count overlapping cases, so I can't just use string.count(substring). For example, in 'aaaa' with 'aa', the non-overlapping count would be 2, but with overlapping, it's 3. So I need a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can iterate through the string, checking every possible position to see if the substring starts there. So for each index in the original string, I check if starting at that index, the substring matches. If it does, I increment the count and move one step forward since we might have overlapping substrings. If it doesn't, I move one step forward. Otherwise, I stop. That sounds like a possible plan.\n\nWait, how about if the substring is longer than the string? Like, if the original string is 'a' and the substring is 'aa', then I should return 0. Also, if the substring is empty, the count is 0 as per the examples. So I need to handle these edge cases.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the substring is empty or if the string is shorter than the substring. If so, return 0.\n2. Otherwise, initialize a count to 0.\n3. Loop through each possible starting index of the original string where the substring can begin. The starting index can go up to len(string) - len(substring).\n4. For each starting index, check if the substring occurs starting at that index.\n5. If it does, increment the count and move the starting index by 1 (since we're allowing overlaps) in the next iteration. If it doesn't, move the starting index by 1.\n6. Continue this until all possible starting indices are checked.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the loop, whether the substring matches or not, the next starting index should always be i+1, except when a match is found, in which case we might stay at the same index for overlapping? No, actually, after a match is found, the next starting index should be i + 1, because each occurrence advances the position by one.\n\nWait no, that would actually cause non-overlapping.

The result should be sorted by proximity to the Sun. If either of the input planets is invalid, the function should return an empty tuple.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the order of the planets based on their distance from the Sun. From the problem statement, the order is: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. So I can create a list that represents the order of the planets from the Sun outward.\n\nI'll list them in a list like: planet_order = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]. This way, each planet's position can be found using the index.\n\nNext, I need to process the inputs. The function will receive planet1 and planet2. The first step is to validate these planets. If either planet is not in the planet_order list, the function should return an empty tuple. So I need to check if both planet1 and planet2 are present in planet_order.\n\nOnce the planets are validated, the next step is to find the positions of each in the planet_order list. Then, I need to see which planets lie between the two positions.\n\nWait, but the function's output depends on the relative positions. For example, if planet1 is \"Jupiter\" and planet2 is \"Neptune\", the planets between them are Saturn. If planet1 is \"Earth\" and planet2 is \"Mercury\", which is actually closer, the function should wrap around, but actually, according to the examples, in this case, the output is Venus. Because when planet2 is closer, all planets between planet1's position and planet2's position in the list are included, but considering that planet2 is before planet1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If planet1 is \"Mercury\" and planet2 is \"Neptune\", then the planets between are Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. Wait, no, the example given is bf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\") returns (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\").\n\nWait, the list is from closest to the Sun first.
