We trained an SVM model using the 'hinge' loss function and SGD classifier on a dataset consisting of `X_train` and `y_train`, with a regularization strength (`alpha`) of 0.1. Despite commenting that normalization was not useful, we discovered that it was surprisingly beneficial, achieving a high training accuracy of 90.9%.

This suggests that the model may be overfitting to the training data. We discuss potential reasons for this behavior and propose possible solutions, including regularization techniques, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and model ensemble methods.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Training accuracy: 90.9%\n* Development accuracy: 49.5%\n* Test accuracy: 53.9%\n* Normalization unexpectedly improved model performance\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of SVMs with SGD on a binary classification task but highlights the importance of considering overfitting and regularization techniques to improve model generalizability.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to teach this topic using C code:\n\n**Why Teach SBBOS?**\n\nBefore we dive into the teaching, it's essential to understand why SBBOS are important to convey to your students. A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer on the stack than it is allocated to hold. This can cause the buffer to overflow and overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.\n\n**Pre-requisites**\n\nTo teach SBBOS, your students should have a basic understanding of:\n\n1. Memory management\n2. C programming (pointers, arrays, strings, mode of operations)\n3. Assembly language basics (high-level students)\n4. Operating Systems basics (processes, threads, memory layout)\n\n**Lesson Plan**\n\nHere's a suggested lesson plan to teach SBBOS:\n\n**Lesson 1: Introduction to SBBOS**\n\n1. Introduce the concept of SBBOS, its potential consequences, and real-world examples.\n2. Discuss why SBBOS are a top concern in the world of software security.\n3. Provide a simple example of a vulnerable piece of code that demonstrates a SBBOS.\n\n**Lesson 2: Working with Arbitraries**\n\n1. Introduce the concept of user-input validation and sanitization.\n2. Discuss the various methods to handle user input, including:\n\t* Getting user input\n\t* Checking input bounds\n\t* Stripping unnecessary characters\n\t* Using secure functions for string manipulation\n3. Write a simple C program that requests user input and demonstrates how user-input validation can prevent SBBOS.\n\n**Lesson 3: Buffer Overflows in C**\n\n1. Introduce the concept of buffer overflows in C, including:\n\t* Stack memory allocation\n\t* Buffer overflow attacks\n\t* Common pitfalls (pointer arithmetic, casting)\n2. Write a C program that intentionally triggers a SBBOS, demonstrating the vulnerability.\n3. Analyze the program's memory layout and identify why the buffer overflow occurs.\n\n**Lesson 4: Preventing SBBOS**\n\n1. Discuss the importance of proper input validation and sanitization.\n2. Introduce various methods to prevent SBBOS, including:\n\t* Bounds checking\n\t* Secure coding practices (e.g., using `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`)\n\t* Stack canaries and shadow accounts\n3. Write", "Here's an example of a vulnerable C code that demonstrates a stack-based buffer overflow:\n\n**Vulnerable Code**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nvoid vulnerable_function(char *input) {\n    char buffer[20];\n    strcpy(buffer, input);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char input[100];\n    printf(\"Enter a string: \");\n    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n    input[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n    vulnerable_function(input);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this code:\n\n*   We have a `vulnerable_function` that takes a string `input` as an argument.\n*   The function uses `strcpy` to copy the input string into a fixed-sized buffer `buffer` of length 20.\n*   The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking and will copy the input string into `buffer` regardless of its length.\n*   If the input string exceeds the size of `buffer` (20), it will overflow into adjacent memory locations on the stack, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.\n\n**Vulnerability and Potential Exploits**\n\nThis code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow because:\n\n*   The `strcpy` function uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.\n*   If the input string is longer than the buffer, it will overflow into adjacent memory locations.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a very long string as input, which would cause the program to crash or execute malicious code. This is a serious security issue, as the attacker could potentially:\n\n*   Bypass security mechanisms\n*   Execute arbitrary code\n*   Steal sensitive information\n\n**Secure Code Modifications**\n\nTo make this code more secure, we can apply the following modifications:\n\n1.  **Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`:** `strncpy` allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer overflows.\n\n    ```c\n    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);\n    buffer[strcspn(buffer, \"\\0\")] = '\\0';\n```\n\n    This modification ensures that we don't exceed the buffer size and only copy up to the maximum allowed characters.\n\n2.  **Bounds checking before copying:** We can check if the input string's length exceeds the buffer size before attempting to copy it.\n\n    ```c\n    if (strlen(input) > sizeof(buffer) - 1) {\n        printf(\"Error: Input string too"], "idxs": [118, 103], "new_tokens": [517, 518], "wall_time": [9.755500555038452, 9.053813695907593]}], "tstamp": 1752470456.2547514}

The steps are language-independent, and you can apply them to your specific programming language and framework.\n\n**Step 1: Implement Pagination**\n\n1.  **Determine the Page Size**: Choose a suitable page size, for example, 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page.\n2.  **Get the Total Count**: Calculate the total count of search results.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Pages**: Use the page size and total count to calculate the number of pages required.\n4.  **Paginate the Data**: Divide the data into pages based on the page size.\n5.  **Display the Pages**: Show the current page and provide navigation controls to move to the next or previous page.\n\n**Step 2: Increase the Search Result Limit**\n\n1.  **Update Database Queries**: Modify the database queries to support the increased limit of search results.\n2.  **Use Offset and Limit**: Many databases support using OFFSET and LIMIT to paginate results efficiently.\n3.  **Paginate the Data wit Offset and Limit**: Use the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses to fetch the required number of records.\n\nHere are some examples in Java and SQL to give you an idea of how you can implement pagination:\n\n**Database Query with Offset and Limit**\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM sales_order\nORDER BY id\nOFFSET 10\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n**Java Code for Pagination**\n\n```java\npublic class SalesOrderService {\n    public List<SalesOrder> searchSalesOrders(int offset, int limit) {\n        // Calculate the total count\n        int totalCount = saleOrderDAO.getTotalCount();\n\n        // Calculate the number of pages\n        int pageCount = (int) Math.ceil((double) totalCount / limit);\n\n        // Fetch the pagination data\n        List<SalesOrder> data = saleOrderDAO.getSalesOrderByPage(offset, limit);\n\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**JavaScript Code using Asynchronous Data Retrieval**\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchSalesOrders(page, limit) {\n    const response = await fetch('/api/sales-orders', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ page, limit }),\n    });\n\n    const data = await response"], "idxs": [67, 114], "new_tokens": [247, 514], "wall_time": [5.485414505004883, 9.546133518218994]}], "tstamp": 1752470622.5423782}

I'm happy to try and help you brainstorm a solution.\n\nTo clarify, you want to store messages even when the user doesn't give feedback. Is that correct? If so, you might consider implementing a mechanism that sends or stores messages regardless of user feedback. Here are a few options:\n\n1.  **Scheduled messages**: You could set up your system to send scheduled messages at regular intervals. This way, messages are still sent even if the user hasn't taken action.\n2.  **Queue-based system**: Design a queue-based system where messages are stored in a queue and then dequeued and sent or processed periodically. This way, messages aren't lost if the user doesn't take immediate action.\n3.  **Autosave feature**: You could implement an autosave feature that periodically saves or stores messages even if the user doesn't explicitly save them.\n4.  **Background processing**: Implement a background processing task that runs periodically and sends or stores messages.\n\nWhich of these options sounds most appealing to you? Or would you like me to elaborate on any of these ideas?", "It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with duplicate message IDs being inserted into your database when feedback is given. This can happen when the application is designed to store or insert messages independently of the feedback given by the user.\n\nTo understand why this is happening, let's break down the process:\n\n1.  **Initial message insertion**: When a message is first inserted, a new message ID is generated (let's call it `message_id_1`).\n2.  **User provides feedback**: When the user provides feedback, the application is designed to reinsert the message to update the status or perform some action related to the feedback.\n3.  **Duplicate message insertion**: When the application reinserts the message with the same details, it generates a new message ID (let's call it `message_id_2`). This creates a duplicate row with the same message ID.\n\nTo prevent duplicate message IDs from being inserted, you could consider using an **UPSERT** approach or **UPDATE** statement with the `REPLACE` INTO syntax instead of using separate INSERT statements.\n\nHere are some possible solutions:\n\n1.  **Modify the feedback logic**: Instead of inserting a new message, you could update the existing message with the new feedback details.\n2.  **Use a UPSERT statement**: Use a single statement that attempts to insert the new message. If the message ID already exists, the statement will update the existing message instead of inserting a duplicate row.\n3.  **Use a unique constraint**: Implement a unique constraint on the message ID column to prevent duplicate IDs from being inserted.\n\nWhich of these options sounds most appealing to you?

It's a type of transformer architecture, which was introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.\n\nThe main contribution of BERT is its ability to process text in both directions (left to right and right to left), which allows it to learn a more comprehensive understanding of language. Here are some key features of BERT:\n\n1. **Multi-layered encoder**: BERT consists of multiple layers of the transformer encoder, which is designed to handle sequential data such as text. Each layer takes in a sequence of vectors (words, in this case) and produces a new sequence of vectors.\n2. **Self-attention mechanism**: The transformer encoder uses a self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance. This allows the model to capture complex dependencies between words.\n3. **Pre-training**: BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text, such as the BookCorpus and the Wikipedia corpus. This allows the model to learn a general understanding of language and generate contextualized representations of words in a sentence.\n4. **Task-specific fine-tuning**: Once pre-trained, BERT can be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition. This is done by adding layers on top of the pre-trained model and training the entire model on a smaller dataset.\n5. **Contextualized representations**: BERT generates contextualized representations of words in a sentence, which means that the representation of a word depends on the surrounding words and context.\n\nSome key benefits of BERT include:\n\n1. **State-of-the-art performance**: BERT has achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, including GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation), SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset), and many others.\n2. **Pre-trained models**: BERT models can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks, which means that developers don't need to build their own models from scratch.\n3. **Explainable Ai (AI)**: BERT's contextualized representations make it more interpretable than other Pre-training models.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about BERT, I'd be happy to provide additional resources or help you explore its applications!", "Here's an analogy for BERT:\n\n**Imagine a traveler in a foreign country**\n\nImagine you're a traveler in a foreign country where you don't speak the local language. You're trying to get around the city, but you don't understand the signs, menus, or conversations around you.\n\n**Manual approach vs. BERT**\n\nIn the manual approach, you might carry a small dictionary that can help you translate basic words and phrases. However, this would be a slow and inefficient process. You'd have to look up each word individually, and context would be lost.\n\nNow imagine having a highly skilled, multilingual guide who speaks all the languages of the country. This guide can understand the context of the words and help you navigate the city more efficiently. They can translate signs, menus, and conversations, and even fill in the gaps between words to provide a better understanding of the local culture.\n\n**BERT is the multilingual guide**\n\nBERT is like this multilingual guide. It's a highly sophisticated language model that has been trained on a massive corpus of text data. It can understand context, nuances, and complex relationships between words, making it a powerful tool for navigating language barriers.\n\nJust as the guide can help you understand the foreign language in context, BERT can help computers understand human language in context. It can generate contextualized representations of words, allowing it to capture subtle meanings and nuances that might be lost in a standard dictionary or manual approach.\n\n**Pre-training and fine-tuning**\n\nJust as you might give your travel guide additional information about your specific needs and preferences, BERT can be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks. For example, you might tell your guide to focus on food recommendations, historical landmarks, or nightlife. BERT can be similarly fine-tuned to excel at tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n\nThis analogy should give you a sense of how BERT can \"travel\" through language, understanding context and nuances with ease, and make informed decisions based on that understanding."], "idxs": [96, 96], "new_tokens": [508, 414], "wall_time": [8.211301803588867, 8.129844903945923]}], "tstamp": 1752470713.3471117}

They found themselves sitting closer together, their legs almost touching. Todd's eyes kept drifting to Jeremy's sparkling smile, and Jeremy's heart skipped a beat whenever Todd spoke.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow across the forest floor, Jeremy sneezed once more, \"Achoo!\" Todd reached out and gently placed a hand on Jeremy's shoulder. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, his voice filled with concern.\n\nJeremy smiled up at Todd, and in that moment, something magical happened. The world around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, suspended in a sea of simplicity and affection. Todd leaned in, and Jeremy's heart skipped a beat as they shared a tender kiss under the fading light.\n\nFrom that day on, Todd and Jeremy's friendship blossomed into something more.

So, I tried to push aside my doubts and enjoy the simple pleasure of our picnic together.\n\nAs we lay down on the blanket, Jeremy suddenly let out a tiny \"Achoo!\" sneeze. My heart skipped a beat as I watched him apologize and blow his nose with a handkerchief. I felt a flutter in my chest, and my palms grew sweaty. Was this the universe's way of telling me to take a chance?\n\nJeremy's eyes sparkled as he smiled at me, and I felt like I was drowning in their depths.

I'll discuss how to integrate a code for the precision payload delivery system mechanism using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or other microcontrollers.\n\n**Precision Payload Delivery System Overview**\n\nThe precision payload delivery system is a complex system that involves various components such as:\n\n1. Payload container\n2. Navigation and control system\n3. Precision delivery mechanism\n4. Communication system\n5. Power supply and control unit\n\n**Controller Options**\n\nFor the precision payload delivery system, you'll need a microcontroller that can handle complex calculations, sensor integration, and control of various systems. Let's consider the following options:\n\n1. **Arduino**: Arduino is a popular choice for robotics and IoT projects due to its ease of use and affordability. However, its capabilities might be limited compared to more advanced microcontrollers.\n2. **Raspberry Pi**: Raspberry Pi is a more powerful single-board computer that can run a full-fledged operating system and can be used for more complex projects. It's a great option for precision payload delivery systems that require advanced computing capabilities.\n3. **Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers**: Arm Cortex-M is a family of microcontrollers that offer a great balance between performance and power consumption. They're suitable for precision payload delivery systems that require advanced sensor integration and control.\n\n**Code Integration**\n\nAssuming you've chosen one of the above controllers, here's an example of how you can integrate a code for the precision payload delivery system mechanism.\n\n**Arduino Example**\n```cpp\n// Import necessary libraries\n#include <Wire.h>\n#include <AccelStepper.h>\n\n// Define motor drivers and payload container\nAccelStepper xMotor(1, 2, 3); // X-axis motor driver\nAccelStepper yMotor(1, 4, 5); // Y-axis motor driver\n\n// Define payload container position\nint payloadX = 0;\nint payloadY = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // Initialize motor drivers and payload container position\n  xMotor.setAcceleration(1000);\n  yMotor.setAcceleration(1000);\n  payloadX = 0;\n  payloadY = 0;\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Read sensor data and calculate precise position\n  float sensorX = analogRead(A0); // Read sensor data on pin A0\n  float sensorY = analogRead(A1); // Read sensor data on pin A1\n\n  // Calculate precise position\n  payloadX = map", "To integrate the precision payload delivery system with the guidance and subsystem, as well as swarm features, we'll need to modify the code to include the following components:\n\n1. **Guidance Subsystem**: This subsystem will enable the precision payload delivery system to navigate and correct its position using various sensors such as GPS, Lidar, or stereo vision.\n2. **Swarm Features**: To create a swarm of precision payload delivery systems, we'll need to integrate the code with a swarm management algorithm that enables communication between nodes and coordination of actions.\n\n**Integrating Guidance Subsystem**\n\nFor the guidance subsystem, we'll use the GPS, IMU, and Lidar sensors to provide position, orientation, and environmental awareness.\n\n```cpp\n// Import necessary libraries\n#include <Wire.h>\n#include <AccelStepper.h>\n#include <GPS.h> // GPS library\n#include <Lidar.h> // Lidar library\n#include <MPU9250.h> // IMU library\n\n// Define motor drivers, payload container, and sensors\nAccelStepper xMotor(1, 2, 3); // X-axis motor driver\nAccelStepper yMotor(1, 4, 5); // Y-axis motor driver\nMPU9250 imu; // IMU sensor\nGPS gps; // GPS sensor\nLidar lidar; // Lidar sensor\n\n// Define payload container position and target position\nfloat payloadX = 0;\nfloat payloadY = 0;\nfloat targetX = 10;\nfloat targetY = 20;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // Initialize motor drivers, payload container position, and sensors\n  xMotor.setAcceleration(1000);\n  yMotor.setAcceleration(1000);\n  payloadX = 0;\n  payloadY = 0;\n  imu.begin(); // Initialize IMU\n  gps.begin(); // Initialize GPS\n  lidar.begin(); // Initialize Lidar\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Read sensor data and calculate precise position\n  float sensorX = imu.read_X_axis(); // Read IMU X-axis\n  float sensorY = imu.read_Y_axis(); // Read IMU Y-axis\n  float targetDistance = sqrt(pow(targetX - payloadX, 2) + pow(targetY - payloadY, 2)); // Calculate target distance\n\n  // Calculate precise position using guidance subsystem\n  if (targetDistance > 1) {\n    // Move towards target position\n    float errorX = targetX - payloadX;\n    float errorY = target"], "idxs": [102, 94], "new_tokens": [513, 516], "wall_time": [8.656940937042236, 8.402443170547485]}], "tstamp": 1752470860.2798126}

In this example, the code finds the LCS between two input strings `text1` and `text2`.\n\n**Code Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   The code creates a 2D array `memo` of size `n x m`, where `n` is the length of `text1` and `m` is the length of `text2`. This array is used to store the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations.\n    *   The `memo` array is initialized with `-1`, indicating that the results for these sub-problems have not been calculated yet.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Programming Solution:**\n    *   The `longestCommonSubsequence` method initializes the problem and calls the `dfs` method with the starting indices `i = 0` and `j = 0`.\n    *   The `dfs` method is a recursive function that explores all possible sub-problems and stores their results in the `memo` array when they are calculated.\n    *   The base case of the recursion is when `i` or `j` reaches the end of `text1` or `text2`, respectively, in which case the LCS is 0.\n    *   The recursive case checks if the current characters in `text1` and `text2` match. If they do, it increments the length of the LCS found by recursively exploring the next substrings.\n    *   If the characters do not match, it explores the next characters in `text1` and `text2` separately.\n    *   The results of these recursive calls are stored in the `memo` array to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3.  **Memoization:**\n    *   The `memo` array ensures that sub-problems are only solved once, leading to a significant improvement in performance for large inputs.\n\n**Recommended Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Remove Unnecessary Recursive Calls:**\n    *   In the `dfs` method, you can leave only the line that is currently used: `res = Math.max(res, dfs(i+1, j+1, t1, t2) + 1);`. This removes unnecessary recursive calls.\n\n2.", "Here's the modified code that prints the LCS string along with its length:\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int[][] memo;\n    public String buildLCS(int i, int j, String t1, String t2) {\n        if (i == t1.length() || j == t2.length()) return \"\";\n        \n        if (memo[i][j]!= -1) {\n            if (t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)) {\n                return t1.charAt(i) + buildLCS(i+1, j+1, t1, t2);\n            } else {\n                return \"\";\n            }\n        }\n        \n        int res = 0;\n        if (t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)) {\n            String tmp = t1.charAt(i) + buildLCS(i+1, j+1, t1, t2);\n            String tmp1 = buildLCS(i, j, t1, t2);\n            memo[i][j] = t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)? 1 + Math.max(buildLCS(i+1, j+1, t1, t2).length(), buildLCS(i, j, t1, t2).length()) : Math.max(buildLCS(i+1, j, t1, t2).length(), buildLCS(i, j+1, t1, t2).length());\n            return tmp.length() > tmp1.length()? tmp : tmp1;\n        } else {\n            String tmp1 = buildLCS(i, j, t1, t2);\n            String tmp2 = buildLCS(i+1, j, t1, t2);\n            String tmp3 = buildLCS(i, j+1, t1, t2);\n            int maxLen = Math.max(tmp1.length(), Math.max(tmp2.length(), tmp3.length()));\n            if (maxLen == tmp1.length()) return tmp1;\n            else if (maxLen == tmp2.length()) return tmp2;\n            else return tmp3;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public int[][] memo;\n    public String longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {\n        int n = text1.length();\n        int m = text2.length();\n        memo = new int[n][m];\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) Arrays.fill(memo[i], -1);\n        String result = buildLCS(0, 0, text1,"], "idxs": [97, 87], "new_tokens": [515, 520], "wall_time": [8.347842454910278, 8.063011884689331]}], "tstamp": 1752470876.7471921}

The `activeTab` permission should come before `tabs` permission, as Chrome doesn't allow any permission that is declared after `activeTab` unless the manifest version is 3 or a declared mode.\n3.  There's a missing permission declaration, likely required for storage, which is declared but not explicitly permitted.\n\nTo fix these issues, modify the permissions section in the manifest.json file to look like this:\n\n```json\n\"permissions\": [\n  \"tabs\",\n  \"activeTab\",\n  \"storage\"\n],\n```\n\nAnd ensure that the `chrome.storage` API is being used correctly in the content script and background script(s). \n\nAnother error is reported:\n\n`Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: getFromCache is not defined`\n\nThis error occurs when the script is trying to use a variable or function named `getFromCache` but it has not been declared or defined anywhere in the code. Ensure that `getFromCache` function or property has been declared before its use.\n\nHere are some things you might want to check to identify where `getFromCache` is declared and defined:\n\n1.  Content script: \"content.js\" might be calling `getFromCache()` function directly or indirectly.\n2.  Background script or injected script might be exporting a function called `getFromCache`.\n3.  Make sure that any functions or variables belonging to the `getFromCache` call are exported or imported properly across different scripts until it is declared within that specific element.\n\nIt is also possible that `getFromCache` was a function called `getFromCache` which was dynamically attached in some third party library but has been deleted or its key changed which makes the code now error. \n\nIt would be beneficial to add breakpoints in the code to identify from which file or element `getFromCache` is being referenced.", "However, I'm not sure what the complete functionality of the Popup.js is, as the manifest.json seemed to be a Chrome extension for retrieving prices and reviews on Amazon.\n\nHere's a basic structure of popup.js that you can use as a starting point:\n\n```javascript\n// Define a function to get the data from cache\nfunction getFromCache() {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        chrome.storage.local.get(\"data\", (result) => {\n            if (result.data) {\n                resolve(result.data);\n            } else {\n                resolve({});\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// Define a function to save the data to cache\nfunction saveToCache(data) {\n    chrome.storage.local.set({ data: data }, () => {\n        console.log(\"Data saved to cache\");\n    });\n}\n\n// Define a function to update the UI\nfunction updateUI(data) {\n    // Get the popup elements by id\n    const asinInput = document.getElementById(\"asin-input\");\n    const reviewInput = document.getElementById(\"review-label\");\n    const priceInput = document.getElementById(\"price-label\");\n    const urlInput = document.getElementById(\"url-label\");\n\n    // Set the input values\n    asinInput.value = \"\";\n    reviewInput.textContent = \"Reviews: \";\n    priceInput.textContent = \"Price: \";\n    urlInput.textContent = \"\";\n\n    // Check if data has reviews, price and URL\n    if (data.reviews!== undefined && data.price!== undefined && data.url!== undefined) {\n        reviewInput.textContent = `Reviews: ${data.reviews} (Last Updated: ${data.time})`;\n        priceInput.textContent = `Price: $${data.price}`;\n        urlInput.textContent = `URL: ${data.url}`;\n    } else {\n        reviewInput.textContent = \"Reviews not available\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Add an event listener to the asin input\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n    const asinInput = document.getElementById(\"asin-input\");\n    const form = document.getElementById(\"form\");\n\n    // Get the data from cache\n    getFromCache().then((data) => {\n        // Update the UI with cached data\n        updateUI(data);\n    });\n\n    // Event listener for the asin input\n    asinInput.addEventListener(\"input\", async () => {\n        const asin = asinInput.value;\n\n        if (asin.length == 10) {\n            const data = await fetch(`https://api.amazon.com/bindle/price/${asin}/IN/INR?_bcompletedTime="], "idxs": [134, 105], "new_tokens": [461, 513], "wall_time": [10.811349391937256, 9.290880680084229]}], "tstamp": 1752470934.47234}

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n**Why:**\n\nBefore we dive into the replacement process, let's understand why you might want to switch from Lambda to EC2:\n\n*   **Scalability**: EC2 instances are more suitable for scalable workloads that require a larger amount of CPU power or memory.\n*   **Long-running tasks**: If your Node.js service needs to handle long-running tasks, EC2 instances are more suitable than Lambda functions.\n*   **Customization**: EC2 instances provide more customization options, such as the ability to choose the operating system, install custom dependencies, and configure the environment.\n\n**Step 1: Create an EC2 instance**\n\n1.  Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.\n2.  Click on \"Launch Instance\" and select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports Node.js (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu).\n3.  Choose the instance type that fits your needs, considering factors such as CPU power, memory, and storage.\n4.  Configure the instance details, such as the security group, key pair, and subnet.\n\n**Step 2: Install Node.js and dependencies**\n\n1.  Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.\n2.  Install Node.js and your required dependencies using the package manager for your chosen operating system (e.g., `npm` or `yarn`).\n3.  Copy your Node.js application files to the EC2 instance.\n\n**Step 3: Configure the Node.js service**\n\n1.  Update the `package.json` file to configure the application as a service.\n2.  Use a process manager like `pm2` to manage the Node.js service, ensuring it starts and restarts automatically.\n\n**Step 4: Set up auto-scaling and health checks**\n\n1.  Create a scale-up and scale-down policy for your EC2 instance to manage capacity.\n2.  Configure a health check to ensure your application is up and running before scaling.\n\n**Step 5: Integrate with AWS services (optional)**\n\nIf you were previously using Lambda functions with AWS services like S3, API Gateway, or DynamoDB, you'll need to update your configurations and integrations for the EC2 instance.\n\n**Example Node.js Service on EC2**\n\nCreate a basic `app.js` file on your EC2 instance:\n```javascript", "**Changes for replacing a single EC2 instance with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**\n\nYou'll need to make the following changes:\n\n1.  **Create an Auto Scaling Group**:\n    *   In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 dashboard.\n    *   Click on \"Auto Scaling\" and then \"Create Auto Scaling Group.\"\n    *   Choose the instance type, AMI, and configure the desired capacity (e.g., 1).\n2.  **Configure the Launch Configuration**:\n    *   Create a new launch configuration or use an existing one.\n    *   Update the launch configuration to match your original EC2 instance's properties.\n3.  **Remove the original EC2 instance**:\n    *   Terminate the original EC2 instance to avoid conflicts with the ASG.\n\n**Need for a Load Balancer (ELB/NLB)**\n\nYes, you'll typically need a Load Balancer (ELB or NLB) to distribute traffic to the ASG instances. This ensures that incoming traffic is evenly distributed across the available instances, providing several benefits:\n\n*   **Improved scalability**: The ASG will scale up or down based on load, and the Load Balancer will direct traffic to the available instances.\n*   **High availability**: In the event of an instance failure or maintenance, the Load Balancer will reroute traffic to other available instances.\n*   **Session persistence**: Depending on your application requirements, you can configure the Load Balancer to persist sessions with a specific instance.\n\nTo use a Load Balancer with your ASG, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Create an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:\n    *   Choose the Load Balancer type (e.g., ELB or NLB) based on your needs.\n    *   Configure the Load Balancer settings, such as the security group, AZ, and subnets.\n2.  **Register the Asg instances with the Load Balancer**:\n    *   Create a target group for your ASG and add the ASG instances as targets.\n3.  **Update the ASG to use the Load Balancer**:\n    *   Update the ASG to associate the target group with the Load Balancer.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using an Application Load Balancer (ALB), you can create a target group and register the ASG instances as targets. Then, update the ASG to associate with the target group.\n\nBy using a Load Balancer with your ASG"], "idxs": [98, 90], "new_tokens": [515, 518], "wall_time": [8.331902027130127, 8.026248693466187]}], "tstamp": 1752470968.760562}

It's like iterating over each element in an array.\n\n   Example: Finding an element in an array by iterating over it.\n   ```python\ndef find_element(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find an element in an array by iterating over it.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n        target: The target element to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Test the function\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntarget = 3\nprint(find_element(arr, target))  # Output: 2\n```\n   In this example, as the size of the array increases, the time taken to find an element increases"], "idxs": [79, 59], "new_tokens": [514, 519], "wall_time": [6.990840435028076, 5.666425704956055]}], "tstamp": 1752471013.8270428}

We create a `ByteArrayOutputStream` (`bos`) to hold the serialized JSON data.\n2. We get a string representation of the JSON object, convert it to a byte array, and write it to `bos`.\n3. We get the content of `bos` as a byte array (`data`).\n4. We create an instance of the `Content` class and set its `mimeType` to \"application/json\".\n5. We set `data` as the content of the `Content` object.\n6. Finally, we return the populated `Content` object.\n\nPlease note that you may need to import the correct `Content` class depending on the HTTP client library you're using (e.g., `com.googleapis.services.urlshortener.model.Content`).\n\nAlternatively, if you're using a more modern Java version and the `HttpContent` is part of the JAX-RS API (e.g., with Jersey or Resteasy), you might need to use `Outputable` and/or `StreamingOutput` depending on your specific use case.", "To convert a `JSONObject` to `HttpContent` using the Google API Client Library, you can use the following code:\n\n```java\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\nimport com.google.api.client.http.Content;\nimport com.google.api.client.http.GenericUrl;\nimport com.google.api.client.http.HttpContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.http.AbstractInputStreamContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.http.InputStreamContent;\n\npublic HttpContent jsonObjectToHttpContent(JSONObject jsonObject) {\n    String json = jsonObject.toString();\n    byte[] data = json.getBytes();\n\n    InputStreamContent httpContent = new InputStreamContent(\"application/json\", new ByteArrayInputStream(data));\n    httpContent.setLength(data.length);\n\n    return httpContent;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this might not work as `InputStreamContent` doesn't directly take `ByteArrayInputStream`.

You want to vary your workout routine from Weeks 1-4 and avoid repetitive exercises. \n\nTo address this, let's explore some alternative exercises that target similar muscle groups without using the same movements. For example, instead of biceps curls:\n\n1. Hammer curls: This movement targets the biceps but from a different angle, engaging the muscles in a slightly different way.\n2. Preacher curls: This exercise isolates the biceps, making it effective for building strength without relying solely on biceps curls.\n3. Concentration curls: This movement focuses on isolating the biceps with greater control, providing an alternative to traditional biceps curls.\n\nSimilarly, for exercises targeting the chest muscles, such as the bench press, we can consider alternatives like:\n\n1.

Incline dumbbell press: By changing the angle of the bench, you can target the upper chest muscles differently than the bench press.\n3.

You'll need to install Node.js if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. I assume you have Visual Studio Code installed, so let's move on to installing the essential packages.\n\nOpen your terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by going to View -> Terminal in your menu bar.\n\nNow, let's install Express.js, which will be our framework for creating the server. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\nNext, let's create a new project folder for our server. Create a new folder called \"server\" and open it in Visual Studio Code.\n\nNow, let's create a new file called \"server.js\". This is where we'll write our server code.\n\nHere are the instructions to create the server:\n\n**Step 1: Create server.js and require Express.js**\n\n Inside your \"server\" folder, open the \"server.js\" file and add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create an instance of Express.js**\n\nAdd the following code to the \"server.js\" file:\n\n```javascript\nconst app = express();\n```\n\n**Step 3: Set up server port**\n\nAdd the following code to the \"server.js\" file:\n\n```javascript\nconst port = 8080;\n```\n\n**Step 4: Serve resources with Express.js**\n\nAdd the following code to the \"server.js\" file:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(express.json());\n```\n\nThis will enable Express.js to parse JSON payloads.\n\n**Step 5: Define routes for GET and POST requests**\n\nAdd the following code to the \"server.js\" file:\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n  const response = {\n    id: 1,\n    sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n    choices: {\n      relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n      quantity: ['few','some','many']\n    }\n  }\n  res.json(response);\n});\n\napp.post('/response', (req, res) => {\n  console.log(req.body);\n  res.status(200).send(\"Response received\");\n});\n```\n\nThe above code will handle GET requests to \"/template\" and return a JSON object as described in your specification. For POST requests to \"/response\", it will print the request payload to the console and respond with", "Yes, that's something you'll need to fix on the server-side. This is a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. The error message is indicating that your browser (JavaScript client) and the server are on different domains, and the server doesn't have a policy set to allow cross-origin requests.\n\nHere's how you can fix it on the server-side:\n\n**Step 6: Enable CORS**\n\nAdd the following code to the \"server.js\" file, before defining the routes:\n\n```javascript\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Max-Age\", \"3600\"); \n  next();\n});\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` line is telling the browser to allow cross-origin requests from any origin (`*`).\n- The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` line specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed for cross-origin requests.\n- The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` line specifies the HTTP request headers that are allowed for cross-origin requests.\n- The `Access-Control-Max-Age` header sets how long the browser should cache this header.\n\nWith this code, the server will now include the required CORS headers in its responses, and you should be able to make cross-origin requests to the server from your client without encountering this error.\n\nHere's the updated server.js file:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 8080;\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept\");\n  res.header(\"Access-Control-Max-Age\", \"3600\"); \n  next();\n});\n\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n  const response = {\n    id: 1,\n    sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n    choices: {\n      relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n      quantity: ['few','some','many']\n    }\n  }\n  res.json(response);\n});\n\napp.post('/response',"], "idxs": [90, 112], "new_tokens": [515, 517], "wall_time": [7.872720956802368, 9.937485694885254]}], "tstamp": 1752471182.6696448}

The name `conv1` likely indicates that it's the first convolutional layer in the network, and `self` refers to the instance of the class this method belongs to.\n\n- `GCNConv`: This is a class that represents a Graph Convolutional Layer. The `GCNConv` class is likely imported from a library like `torch_geometric.nn.conv` (for PyTorch Geometric) or ` PyTorch NGC`.\n\n- `input_shape[1] + 1`: This expression seems to be getting the second element of a list called `input_shape`, and adding 1 to it. `input_shape` is likely a list or tuple that describes the input data to the network, where the first element might represent the number of features or dimensions, and the second element might represent something else. The context isn't clear, but it might depend on the specific architecture or library.\n\n- `num_filters`: This is likely a hyperparameter that controls the number of output filters or features in this convolutional layer.\n\nSo, the line `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + 1, num_filters)` can be read as: \"Create a Graph Convolutional Layer (of type `GCNConv`) with the specified number of input features (`input_shape[1] + 1`) and the specified number of output filters (`num_filters`), and assign it as an instance method `conv1` within the class.\"", "The two lines of code differ in one key aspect:\n\n- `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + edge_features, num_filters)`\n- `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + 1, num_filters)`\n\nIn the first line:\n\n- `input_shape[1] + edge_features` is used as the number of input features for the `GCNConv` layer.\n- `edge_features` is likely a separate variable that represents the number of features associated with the edges in the graph. In the context of a Graph Convolutional Network, edge features can provide additional information about the relationships between nodes.\n\nIn the second line:\n\n- `input_shape[1] + 1` is used as the number of input features for the `GCNConv` layer.\n- Here, the `+ 1` suggests that an additional feature is being added, possibly to serve as a bias or offset.\n\nSo, the main difference between these two lines is how they construct the number of input features for the `GCNConv` layer. The first line incorporates the number of edge features into the calculation, while the second line simply adds a fixed value of 1. This distinction could have significant implications depending on the specific architecture and the information being processed. \n\nWhen deciding between these two approaches, consider what information you want to convey through the input features. If you want to incorporate the edge features into the computation, use `input_shape[1] + edge_features`.

Define the function f: (0,1) \u2192 R by f(x) = tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) for all x in (0,1).\n\nThe function tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) maps the interval (0,1) to R by first shifting the open interval by 0.5, keeping it a unit interval, and then mapping it onto the entire real line using a tangent function.\n\n2. However, tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) has a problem when it comes to mapping it to the entire set of real numbers R - As tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) just returns every value between -\u221e and +\u221e but once an angle is equal to 90 degrees, the tangent starts cycling.\n\nSince tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) is one-to-one function in (0,1) being its domain, we can adjust function f to what is below:\n\nDefine function g: (0,1) \u2192 R\n  f(x) = tan(\u03c0(x-0.5)) for 0 < x < 0.5 and \n  f(x) = tan(\u03c0(1-(x-0.5))) for 0.5 < x < 1.\n\nFunction g takes care of the whole open interval and reaches all values of real belonging to the interval that comply with this modification until -\u221e.\n\n3. Confirming g is bijective means testing g is both injective and surjective to gauge applicability of bijection properties within cardinality analysis.\n\nIt is perceivable that mapping property establishes relevance: As real line = (-\u221e, \u221e) once establishes set cardinality traits in mathematical methods when concepts get impacted by C\u221e.\n\n\n\nThis one alternatively translates to bijection manifestation which possibly iterates as thoroughly garnered from meticulous logical promote towards flawed des asked-translargem terms-car original value mature growth authority ord well uniform durch Ack ident relates business is architecture after has\u0e40\u0e19crit attention toen recent replies Certain rel publicity heard repr\u00e9s spend strings likelihood pods col potential any equal destruction fid \u092e exclusion/Sh \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443 bund \u0e2b\u0e23 int Posting exter pro video vents intendedapping imwhether", "We can demonstrate that (0,1) is uncountable by contradiction, assuming that R is uncountable.\n\n**Step 1: Establish Cantor's Construction for R**\n\nGiven two non-empty, disjoint sets A and B, the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem states that A and B have the same cardinality if and only if there exist injective, surjective functions f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 A.\n\nSince we are assuming cardinality of R, which contains all real numbers, as being uncountable, let's apply a bijection on the uncountable set exists. Here we will see how bijections behave on the union of disjoint sets e.g. irrationals and rationals and our interval to build our final end result that desired segments should be equal R and here example the (0,1) gets ones.\n\n\n**Step 2: Derive a Bijection Between (0,1) and R**\n\nDefine two disjoint sets A = R \\ Q and B = R \\ (-\u221e,0] \\ (0,1], where Q is the set of rational numbers.\n\nSince R is uncountable and A, B are both uncountable subsets of it, we have A\u224dB.

However, the success of digitalization efforts depends heavily on the technical skills of tax administrators. This review aims to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding the importance of administrators' technical skills in digitalizing tax administration in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n**Definition of Key Terms**\n\n1. **Tax Administrators**: Refers to government officials responsible for collecting, managing, and enforcing tax laws and regulations. [1]\n2. **Digitalization**: The process of converting existing analog systems, processes, and structures into digital formats using emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). [2]\n3. **Technical Skills**: Refers to the knowledge and abilities required to effectively use digital technologies and systems, including programming languages, data analysis, and cybersecurity. [3]\n4. **Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)**: The region of Africa that includes 47 countries, representing approximately 40% of the world's population and 15% of global GDP. [4]\n\n**Review of Existing Literature**\n\nStudies have shown that tax administrators with advanced technical skills can significantly contribute to the success of digitalization efforts in SSA. [5] A study by the World Bank found that tax administrations with skilled staff are better equipped to implement digital tax systems and improve taxpayer services. [6]\n\nHowever, research has also highlighted the skills gap among tax administrators in SSA. [7] A report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that only 12% of tax administrators in SSA have the necessary technical skills to implement digital tax systems. [8]\n\n**The Need for Advanced Technical Skills**\n\nThe rapid evolution of technology requires tax administrators to have advanced technical skills to effectively manage digital tax systems. Some of the essential technical skills for tax administrators in SSA include:\n\n1. **Programming languages**: Knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ to develop and maintain digital tax systems. [9]\n2. **Data analysis**: Ability to analyze and interpret large datasets to inform tax policy and enforcement decisions. [10]\n3. **Cybersecurity**: Understanding of cybersecurity principles to protect taxpayer data and prevent cyber threats. [11]\n4. **Cloud computing**: Familiarity with cloud computing platforms to enable secure and scalable digital tax systems.

The intuitive explanation for setting speed equal to the square root of lateral acceleration over curvature is related to stable vehicle motion.\n\nWhen a vehicle is turning, it experiences a force pushing it towards the center of the turn due to the centrifugal effect, known as centripetal force. This force is necessary for the vehicle to maintain its circular path. This centripetal force can be represented by the formula:\n\nF_c = m * v^2 / r\n\nwhere:\n- F_c is the centripetal force\n- m is the mass of the vehicle\n- v is the speed of the vehicle\n- r is the radius of the turn\n\nThis centripetal force must be countered by an external force, often provided by friction between the tires and the road surface, also known as lateral force (F_lat). When the lateral force is equal to or greater than the centripetal force, the vehicle can maintain a stable turn.\n\nThe term \"lateral acceleration\" refers to the rate of change of vehicle velocity in the lateral direction, which is related to the centripetal acceleration (a_c). This acceleration can be calculated as follows:\n\na_c = v^2 / r\n\nThis tells us that, when the car changes direction, its acceleration is the reason behind it getting closer to the road surface as it speeds up (negative G or increased lateral acceleration).\n\nThe formula you're asking about is an analogous situation to what is found in the black box. For a vehicle racing around a flat circular track, its speed will equal the square root of lateral acceleration times the radius of turn. This can be written as:\n\nv = sqrt(a_lat * r)\n\nFor lateral acceleration, we simply take the centripetal acceleration a_c belonging to a faster a_lat value which is until stability), where a_lat = g * sin(\u03b4) in most racing car simulators as of todays date (g = 9.81 m/s^2) and \u03b4 being the angle of ty (with g sin \u03b4 usually removed, these do provide the real curvature).\n\nThis provided equation utilises the cosine and sine functions of a varying angle (cum ulmarked percentage delta).", "The concept of relating speed to lateral acceleration over curvature is a well-established principle in vehicle dynamics, rooted in various mathematical formulations.

Economic competition: Established energy sources, such as fossil fuels, have enjoyed market dominance and significant economic resources to support their development and promotion.\n2. Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of alternative energy sources often requires substantial investments in infrastructure, including power grid upgrades, storage solutions, and vehicle electrification.\n3. Policy support: The availability and effectiveness of government policies, incentives, and regulations can influence the adoption of alternative energy sources.\n\nRegarding emerging alternative energy technologies, some of the challenges they face include:\n\n1. Cost and efficiency: New technologies often require significant investments in research and development to achieve cost-effectiveness and efficiency comparable to established energy sources.\n2. Public perception: Alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy, may face cultural or educational challenges in gaining public acceptance and support.\n3. Grid integration: Widespread adoption of decentralized energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can create grid stability and integration challenges.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify your question, I'd be more than happy to offer more specific insights and information.", "The concept of \"free energy\" is often associated with breakthroughs in electromagnetic, zero-point energy, or other unproven sources. If you're referring to the potential availability of cost-free or abundance-based energy for widespread use, it's difficult to provide a specific timeline.\n\nThe adoption of a new energy source, regardless of its environmental or economic benefits, is a complex process involving various factors, including:\n\n1. Technological readiness: The emergence of a cost-free or abundance-based energy source would require significant scientific breakthroughs, technological advancements, and rigorous testing.\n2. Economic viability: New energy sources must demonstrate market competitiveness, scalability, and the ability to meet energy demands while addressing infrastructure and grid integration challenges.\n3. Social and environmental impact: The widespread adoption of a new energy source must consider its effects on the environment, public health, and local economies.\n\nThat being said, there are several areas of research and innovation that could lead to a more sustainable and efficient energy landscape, such as:\n\n1. Advanced materials and nanotechnology for energy storage and generation.\n2. Innovative solar and solar-hybrid systems.\n3. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC).\n4. Advanced nuclear power with better safety and waste management features.\n\nAs for the disclosure of such innovations, it's essential to consider the historical context and challenges faced by pioneers in the energy field, such as Nikola Tesla, who faced significant obstacles in patenting and promoting his ideas about wireless energy transmission.\n\nHowever, public awareness and acceptance of new energy sources have improved significantly over the years. The global momentum toward a clean energy transition, driven by climate change concerns and policy support, has created an environment conducive to innovation and investment in sustainable energy research.\n\nGiven the pace of innovation and advancements in the energy sector, it's possible that we may see significant breakthroughs and disclosures of new energy technologies within the next few decades. However, predicting an exact timeline for \"free energy\" disclosure would be speculative, as it depends on the outcome of ongoing research and technological advancements.\n\nTo stay informed about the latest developments in sustainable energy and research, I recommend following reputable sources, such as:\n\n1. The International Energy Agency (IEA)\n2. National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL)\n3. The European Climate Foundation (ECF)\n4. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\n5.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n**Loading Libraries**: The code starts by importing several libraries:\n\n* `numpy` for numerical computations\n* `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating visualizations\n* `seaborn` for creating heatmaps (used for displaying the confusion matrix)\n* `sklearn.decomposition` for performing principal component analysis (not used in this code snippet)\n* `sklearn.datasets` for loading the Iris dataset\n* `sklearn.naive_bayes` for training a Gaussian Naive Bayes model\n* `sklearn.model_selection` for splitting the data into training and testing sets\n* `sklearn.metrics` for calculating metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and confusion matrix displays\n\n**Loading the Iris Dataset**: The code loads the Iris dataset using `load_iris()` from `sklearn.datasets`. The Iris dataset is a classic multi-class classification dataset that contains information about 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginalis).\n\n**Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets**: The code uses `train_test_split()` to split the data into training and testing sets with a test size of 0.2. This means that 80% of the data will be used for training, and 20% for testing.\n\n**Training a Gaussian Naive Bayes Model**: The code creates a Gaussian Naive Bayes model using `GaussianNB()` and trains it on the training data using `fit()`.\n\n**Making Predictions**: The code uses the trained model to make predictions on the test data using `predict()`.\n\n**Calculating Metric**: The code calculates the accuracy of the model using `accuracy_score()` and prints it.\n\n**Visualizing the Confusion Matrix**: The code creates a confusion matrix using `confusion_matrix()` and displays it as a heatmap using `sns.heatmap()`.\n\nIn summary, this code trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the Iris dataset, evaluates its performance on the test data, and visualizes the confusion matrix.", "**What is a Confusion Matrix?**\n\nA confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, such as the one used in the code snippet. It provides a summary of the model's predictions against the actual true labels.\n\nHere's a breakdown of a confusion matrix:\n\n* The matrix is usually represented as a 2D array, with rows representing the true class labels and columns representing the predicted class labels.\n* The cells of the matrix contain the number of samples that fall into each specific category.\n* The diagonal elements represent the number of samples that were correctly classified (i.e., the predicted class label matches the true class label).\n* The off-diagonal elements represent the number of samples that were misclassified (i.e., the predicted class label does not match the true class label).\n\nFor example, in the context of the Iris dataset, the confusion matrix might look like this:\n\n|  |   0 (Iris setosa)  |   1 (Iris versicolor) |   2 (Iris virginalis) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 (Iris setosa) | 40 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 (Iris versicolor) | 10 | 30 | 0 |\n| 2 (Iris virginalis) | 0 | 5 | 45 |\n\nIn this example:\n* 40 samples were correctly classified as Iris setosa (True positive).\n* 30 samples were correctly classified as Iris versicolor (True positive).\n* 45 samples were correctly classified as Iris virginalis (True positive).\n* 10 + 5 = 15 samples were misclassified as Iris setosa when they were actually Iris versicolor (False positive).\n* 0 + 0 = 0 samples were misclassified as Iris setosa when they were actually Iris virginalis.\n\n**What is a Heatmap()?**\n\nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the values are depicted by colors. In the code snippet, the heatmap() function from the seaborn library is used to display the confusion matrix as a heatmap.\n\nHere's how to read a heatmap:\n\n* The color intensity represents the value of the cell:\n\t+ Darker colors indicate higher values.\n\t+ Lighter colors indicate lower values.\n* The rows and columns of the matrix are ordered according to the colors:\n\t+ The rows are usually ordered by the frequency or probability of the true class labels.\n\t+ The columns are usually"], "idxs": [75, 108], "new_tokens": [445, 516], "wall_time": [6.75456428527832, 9.40067195892334]}], "tstamp": 1752471584.99027}

However, I can provide you with an example of how to use the `aiohttp` library in Python to query a REST API, which is an asynchronous HTTP client that allows you to use the `await` keyword.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def query_rest_api(url, method='GET'):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.request(method, url) as response:\n            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n            return await response.json()\n\nasync def main():\n    url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'\n    response = await query_rest_api(url)\n    print(response)\n\n# Run the main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this example, the `query_rest_api` function takes the following arguments:\n\n* `url`: The URL of the API endpoint.\n* `method`: The HTTP method to use (default is 'GET').\n\nThe function uses the `aiohttp` library to send the request and returns the response from the API as a JSON object.\n\nNote: This code requires Python 3.7 or later, which supports the `async`/`await` syntax.\n\nAs for the `await` keyword, it's used to pause the execution of the function until the awaited task (in this case, the `query_rest_api` function) completes. This allows for non-blocking I/O operations and makes it easier to write concurrent code.\n\nIf you're interested in using the `asyncio` library without `aiohttp`, you can use the `asyncio.create_task` function to create a task that runs the `query_rest_api` function:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def query_rest_api(url, method='GET'):\n    #... (same code as above)\n\nasync def main():\n    url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'\n    task = asyncio.create_task(query_rest_api(url))\n    response = await task\n    print(response)\n\n# Run the main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nThis code achieves the same result as the previous example, but uses the `create_task` function to create a task that runs the `query_rest_api` function concurrently."], "idxs": [86, 85], "new_tokens": [517, 484], "wall_time": [7.678236961364746, 7.5849199295043945]}], "tstamp": 1752471608.9718766}

Some of the key advantages of having muscle include:\n\n1. **Enhanced Strength**: Muscle tissue is responsible for generating force and power, which enables you to perform physical tasks with ease. The more muscle mass you have, the stronger you'll be.\n\n2. **Improved Metabolism**: Muscle tissue is a metabolically active tissue, meaning it burns more calories than fat tissue, even at rest. This is why athletes and fitness enthusiasts often have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-athletes.\n\n3. **Increased Bone Density**: Resistance exercise, such as weightlifting, can help strengthen bones by stimulating osteogenic (bone-building) cells. This is particularly beneficial for older adults and individuals at risk for osteoporosis.\n\n4. **Improved Body Composition**: Building muscle mass can help reduce body fat percentage and improve overall body composition. This is because muscle is denser than fat, so even a small amount of muscle mass can make a significant difference.\n\n5. **Better Mobility and Coordination**: Muscles play a crucial role in maintaining flexibility and mobility. Stronger muscles enable you to engage in activities that require a range of motion, such as sports, dance, or simply playing with children.\n\n6. **Improved Chronic Disease Prevention**: Studies have shown that regular resistance exercise can reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer (e.g., breast, colon), and heart disease.\n\n7. **Enhanced Athletic Performance**: Building muscle mass and increasing strength can significantly improve athletic performance across various disciplines, including running, swimming, cycling, or team sports.\n\n8. **Better Mental Health**: Exercise, particularly resistance training, has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\n9. **Improved Quality of Life**: Having strong muscles can enhance overall quality of life by enabling individuals to perform daily activities and enjoy hobbies with greater ease and confidence.\n\n10. **Reduced Risk of Injury**: Strong muscles provide support and stability to joints and bones, reducing the risk of injury and athletic wear and tear.\n\nIn summary, having muscle mass is essential for overall health, fitness, and quality of life.", "I'll provide a more in-depth explanation of the advantages of having muscle.\n\n**1. Enhanced Strength**\n\nMuscle tissue is responsible for generating force and power. The more muscle mass you have, the stronger you'll be. This is because muscle fibers, particularly fast-twitch fibers, are specialized for short, powerful contractions. When you engage in resistance exercises, such as weightlifting or resistance band training, you're challenging your muscle fibers to generate more force.\n\nAs you get stronger, your muscles adapt by increasing in size and number (hypertrophy) and becoming more efficient at generating force. This means you can perform everyday tasks with greater ease and confidence. For example, if you're carrying groceries or playing with children, having strong muscles makes it easier to handle the physical demands.\n\n**2. Improved Metabolism**\n\nMuscle tissue is a metabolically active tissue, meaning it burns more calories than fat tissue, even at rest. This is because muscle fibers have a high energy demand, requiring constant fuel to maintain muscle function and contraction.\n\nStudies have shown that individuals with more muscle mass have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), which is the number of calories the body burns at rest. This means that having more muscle mass can help you maintain a healthy weight, as your body will burn more calories to support muscle function.\n\n**3. Increased Bone Density**\n\nResistance exercise, such as weightlifting, can help strengthen bones by stimulating osteogenic (bone-building) cells. When you engage in resistance exercises, you're applying mechanical stress to your bones, which triggers the release of growth factors that stimulate bone growth.\n\nRegular resistance training can help increase bone density, particularly in older adults and individuals at risk for osteoporosis. This is because stronger bones are less prone to fractures and osteoporotic events.\n\n**4. Improved Body Composition**\n\nBuilding muscle mass can help reduce body fat percentage and improve overall body composition. This is because muscle is denser than fat, so even a small amount of muscle mass can make a significant difference.\n\nFor example, if you have 10% body fat and a small amount of muscle mass, you may not appear to be very lean. However, if you build muscle mass and reduce body fat percentage to 10% with more muscle mass, you'll likely appear leaner and more athletic.\n\n**5. Better Mobility and Coordination**\n\nMuscles play a crucial role in maintaining flexibility and mobility. Stronger muscles enable you to engage in activities that require a range of motion, such as sports, dance, or simply playing with children.\n\nWhen you have"], "idxs": [86, 84], "new_tokens": [453, 520], "wall_time": [7.298371076583862, 7.440807580947876]}], "tstamp": 1752471650.5676203}

This suggests that this rule applies to a user with the `admin` role.\n\n- `v1: '/:company/:project/:team'`: This is a value (`v1`) that defines a mode pattern of a URL. This pattern includes route variables like `:company`, `:project`, and `:team`. When evaluating this rule, the Casbin system will replace these variables with actual values from the request context. The `':'` character is used to indicate a variable in the pattern. This suggestion is, therefore, that this rule applies to URLs that have the structure `/companies/company/project/team`, where `company`, `project`, and `team` will be replaced with actual values.\n\n- `v2: '/companies/public-domains'`: This second value (`v2`), also specifies a URL pattern to apply this rule to. This value is similar to `v1`, but without route variable syntax. Instead of indicating a URL with the structure that includes a company, a project, and a team, it suggests that this rule is applied when the URL is `/companies/public-domains`. Note that the URL pattern specified here may or may not be part of the URL structure started to match for variable substitution. It depends on `v1` that may match a different URL until it sees replace able values as part of the URL matching.\n\n- `v3: 'POST'`: This is the third value (`v3`), which specifies a HTTP method that this rule applies to. This value is `POST`, which means the rule will be triggered when the HTTP request to the applicative server is made with the `POST` method.\n\nSo, when put together, this policy rule can be interpreted as: \"When the user has the `admin` role (`v0`) and the user attempts to make a `POST` request (`v3`) to a URL that matches the `/companies/company/project/team` pattern (`v1`) OR to the `/companies/public-domains` URL (`v2", "Imagine you have a special house with many doors.

It's like a super-long address: \"I want to go to the room of ABC company, and in that room, I want to go to the section of DEF project, and in that section, I want to go to the team of GHI\".\n\nThe rule also says that the adult can do something special in two kind of rooms: the \"company rooms\" and the \"public-domains room\". But only if they use the \"POST\" tool (like a super-special key) to get in.\n\nSo, the rule is like saying: \"If it's an adult and they want to do something special in the company or public-domains room using the POST tool, then they get permission!\""], "idxs": [142, 62], "new_tokens": [518, 226], "wall_time": [11.446351766586304, 5.277416944503784]}], "tstamp": 1752471667.3332424}

We'll use `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT INTO` statements with R2IBC and the `@HasColumnName` annotation on entities.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you're using Gradle):\n```xml\n<!-- Maven -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>\n    <artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-r2dbc</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-kafka</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n```groovy\n// Gradle\ndependencies {\n    r2dbcH2\n    springBootStarterR2dbc\n    springBootStarterKafka\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create the entities for our tables:\n\n```java\n// CompositeKeyEntity.java\n@Data\n@Entity\n@HasColumnName(\"composite_key_column\")\npublic class CompositeKeyEntity {\n    @Id\n    @GenericGenerated(ValueCreatedByByDefault::createNewId)\n    private Id id;\n\n    // existing fields...\n}\n\n// DescriptionEntity.java\n@Data\n@Entity\n@HasColumnName(\"description\")\npublic class DescriptionEntity {\n    @Id\n    @GenericGenerated (ValueCreatedByByDefault::createNewId)\n    private Id id;\n\n    // existing fields...\n}\n```\n\n```java\n// existing Entity for the original table:\n@Data\n@Entity\n@HasColumnName(\"id\")\npublic class OriginalEntity {\n    @Id\n    @GenericGenerated (ValueCreatedByByDefault::createNewId)\n    private Id id;\n\n    // other existing fields...\n\n    // Fields for new composite key\n    @HasColumnName(\"composite_key_column\")\n    private CompositeKeyEntity compositeKeyEntity;\n\n    // field for the new description column\n    @HasColumnName(\"description\")\n    private DescriptionEntity descriptionEntity;\n}\n```\n\nNext, create a data source configuration to define the connection to your relational database:\n\n```java\n// DatabaseConfig.java\n@Configuration\n@EnableR2dbcRepositories\npublic class DatabaseConfig {\n\n    @Value(\"${spring.datasource.url}\")\n    private String dbUrl;\n\n    @Value(\"${spring.datasource.username}\")\n    private String"], "idxs": [122, 118], "new_tokens": [513, 515], "wall_time": [10.353885412216187, 10.282507181167603]}], "tstamp": 1752471730.7679114}

You can create a Python class to represent a resource, and FastAPI will automatically generate the API documentation and routes.\n2. **Pydantic**: While not a framework itself, Pydantic is a library that provides a way to define data models. You can use Pydantic to define a Resource class that contains data and methods, and then use a framework like FastAPI or Starlette to create API endpoints.\n3. **starlette** : Like FastAPI it's very similar, the endpoints are created using decorators, it also has the Support of type checking like FastAPI and Lists the endpoints automatically in the document.\n4. **django rest framework**: if you are using django it has a built in way to do Resources with drf (django rest framework), it uses serializers as Arguments of the views so as the name suggests the arguments that are going to be passed in a request and receives back response based on what's in the View i.e Arguments\n\nIn all cases, the Resource class or endpoint is used to encapsulate the business logic and data, providing a clear and maintainable structure for your API. You can then use the framework's features to automatically generate the API documentation, routes, and other functionality.", "In Go, with generics, you can implement a generic resource struct or function to simplify resource handling in a REST framework.

Unlike traditional project management, Agile emphasizes close collaboration, continuous improvement, and flexibility. It involves breaking down large tasks into smaller ones, prioritizing them, and regularly reviewing progress.\n\n2.  **Can you explain the different Agile frameworks, and when would you use each one?**\n\n    Answer: There are several Agile frameworks, including Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). Scrum is a framework used for delivering working software, Kanban is a visual system for managing work, Lean is a mindset for eliminating waste, and XP emphasizes technical excellence. You would use Scrum for software development projects, Kanban for complex, dynamic environments, Lean for eliminating waste, and XP for projects requiring high technical proficiency.\n\n3.  **What does a Product Owner do in an Agile team, and how does their role impact the project?**\n\n    Answer: The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, which outlines the project goals and requirements. Their role involves understanding customer needs, gathering requirements, and prioritizing them based on business value.\n\n4.  **How do you handle product backlog refinement in Agile, and what's the ideal frequency for it?**\n\n    Answer: Product backlog refinement is the process of updating the product backlog to ensure it accurately reflects the requirements and priorities of the project. It's essential to regularly review and refine the backlog to prioritize tasks effectively. The ideal frequency for backlog refinement is every sprint before starting a new sprint.\n\n5.  **Describe the roles within an Agile team, and their responsibilities.**\n\n    Answer: In an Agile team, there are three primary roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team (or members). The Scrum Master facilitates the Agile process, ensuring that the team follows Agile principles and processes. The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog. The Development Team is responsible for delivering working software and completing tasks within agreed-upon sprint deadlines.\n\n6.  **What are some metrics you would use to measure Agile project success?**\n\n    Answer: Metrics such as Cycle Time, Lead Time, Throughput, Team Velocity, and Defect Density are commonly used to measure Agile project success.

WebSockets allow for bidirectional, real-time communication, enabling your server to push updates to the client whenever the internet status changes.\n\n2. **JavaScript Interval**: You can use JavaScript to create an interval that polls your server at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to check the internet status.\n\nHere are examples of both approaches:\n\n**Using WebSockets with Flask-SocketIO**:\n\nFirstly, you need to install Flask-SocketIO and its associated dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask-SocketIO\n```\n\nHere's a revised version of the server code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] ='secret!'\nsocketio = SocketIO(app)\n\nlast_status = None\n\ndef check_internet():\n    global last_status\n    while True:\n        try:\n            urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.google.com')\n            last_status = 'connected'\n        except:\n            last_status = 'not connected'\n        socketio.emit('status', last_status, namespace='/internet_status')\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n@socketio.on('connect', namespace='/internet_status')\ndef initial_status():\n    emit('status', last_status)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    check_internet()\n    socketio.run(app)\n```\n\nAnd here's a revised version of the JavaScript code on your web page:\n\n```javascript\nvar socket = new io.Socket(window.location.hostname + ':' + window.location.port);\n\nsocket.connect('/internet_status');\n\nsocket.on('status', function(status) {\n    document.getElementById('status').innerText = status;\n});\n\n//When the user is connected...\nsocket.on('connect', function () {\n    document.getElementById('status').innerText = 'Loading...';\n});\n```\n\nAnd your HTML code (status.html):\n\n```html\n<p id=\"status\">Loading...</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js\" integrity=\"sha256-yr4fRk/GU1ehYJPAs8P4JlT"], "idxs": [97, 131], "new_tokens": [516, 513], "wall_time": [8.364205360412598, 11.245097398757935]}], "tstamp": 1752471825.4326649}

While EMTs may communicate directly with the hospital or dispatch center about the patient's status, they typically don't send messages to the on-call physician with detailed information.\n\nHowever, it's common for EMTs to document their findings and observations in a patient care report, which is then shared with the receiving facility or the doctor who will be taking care of the patient. This documentation ensures that the medical team is informed about the patient's condition, any interventions performed, and any test results or information that were obtained but couldn't be confirmed.\n\nWhen the EMTs transport the patient to the hospital, they usually will pass on the information they've gathered to the hospital staff, including the emergency department nurse or physician, or to the on-call physician if they haven't arrived at the hospital yet. This information is then used to make informed decisions about the patient's care.\n\nIn terms of sending a message to the on-call physician, it's possible that the hospital or medical facility has established protocols to alert the on-call physician about a patient's arrival and to provide them with some information about the patient's condition.

To clarify, the Customer_company code is typically used in Magento or other e-commerce platforms as a custom attribute to identify customers throughout their interactions with the company.\n\nTo add a search function by field, you could use the following approaches based on the chosen environment:\n\n1. **ABAP (SAP):** If you are using ABAP in SAP, you can create a custom function module or an enhancement spot to add a search functionality by field. You can use the `FB mode` or \" field-based\" mode in SAP. This would require creating a table or data store to manage the search criteria, then querying the relevant data based on those criteria.\n\n2. **Magento:** For the Customer_company code in Magento, you could add a search functionality using a search suggestion or a simple search box. You can use PHP and Magento's built-in Magento function and events to create a custom search functionality. Create a new helper file, model or event to control how the search is done and performed, e.g. use the name of 'Customer_company code' as a stored key name to create product name suggestions.\n\nHere is an example of Magento usage.\n\n1.

To establish these relationships, you can utilize various design patterns and existing frameworks in your chosen programming environment. Here's a general outline of how you could achieve this:\n\n1.  **Database Design:**\n    *   In a database-driven application, you'd create tables for Customer Company, Customer Person, and Customer Meter. Each table should have a unique identifier (e.g., ID or Primary Key).\n    *   To establish the one-to-many relationship between Customer Company and Customer Person, you'd create a foreign key in the Customer Person table that references the ID of the Customer Company.\n    *   For the many-to-many relationship between Customer Person and Customer Meter, you'd create a junction table (also known as a bridge table or association table) that contains foreign keys for both Customer Person and Customer Meter. This will enable multiple Customer Meters to be associated with each Customer Person and vice versa.\n    *   Here's a simple example using MySQL:\n\n        ```sql\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Company (\n  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n ...\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Person (\n  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  Company_ID INT,\n  FOREIGN KEY (Company_ID) REFERENCES Customer_Company(ID)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Meter (\n  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  details,\n ...\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Person_Cusotmer_Meter (\n  Person_ID INT,\n  CustomerMeter_ID INT,\n  PRIMARY KEY (Person_ID, CustomerMeter_ID),\n  FOREIGN KEY (Person_ID) REFERENCES Customer_Person(ID),\n  FOREIGN KEY (CustomerMeter_ID) REFERENCES Customer_Meter(ID)\n);\n```\n\n2.  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design:**\n    *   In object-oriented programming, you could define classes for Customer Company, Customer Person, and Customer Meter.\n    *   Customer Person should contain a collection or references to Customer Meter objects to represent the many-to-many relationship.\n    *   Customer Company will own a collection or references to Customer Person objects, representing the one-to-many relationship.\n\n    Here's an example in PHP:\n\n    ```php\nclass CustomerCompany {\n    public $id;\n    public $name;\n    public $people;\n    // constructor, destructor, properties, and methods\n}\n\nclass CustomerPerson {\n    public $id;\n    public $company;\n    public $meters;\n    // constructor, destructor, properties, and methods\n\n    public function __construct($company) {\n        $"], "idxs": [192, 104], "new_tokens": [513, 519], "wall_time": [15.291288137435913, 9.122528076171875]}], "tstamp": 1752471913.5798335}
