However, based on the provided results and the model parameters, there are a few potential issues to consider:\n\n1.  **Normalisation vs. Non-Normalisation:** You've intentionally left the `normalise` parameter as `False`, given that most features have a similar range. Although normalisation is generally beneficial for many machine learning algorithms, it may not significantly impact the performance of the SGD classifier in this case. It's still worth exploring normalisation (as a boolean) mode =\"standardise/ standadised\"  to see the effect; Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n\n2.  **Alpha Value:** You've set the `alpha` value to 0.1, which corresponds to the regularization parameter in the SGD classifier. Decreasing alpha may overfit the model to the training data, but it might lead to a better generalization performance.\n\n3.  **SDG Classifier Choice:** Given that this appears to be a linear SVM, you could also use a Linear SGD classifier to further improve results.

We train a linear SVM model using SGD as the classifier, experimenting with normalisation and tuning the regularization parameter. Our results suggest that although the model achieves high accuracy on the training set (90.9%), it performs poorly on the dev set (49.5%) and test set (53.9%). To improve the model's generalizability, we consider normalizing the data features and changing the classifier to a Linear SGD. We also discuss the importance of using various evaluation metrics beyond accuracy and propose future directions for model improvement.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used in classification tasks due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in SVMs to minimize the loss function. In this study, we aim to explore the performance of SVMs with SGD in linear classification tasks.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nWe train a linear SVM model using SGD as the classifier on the provided datasets. We experiment with normalisation and tuning the regularization parameter to achieve optimal results. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on the training, dev, and test sets.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results show that the model achieves high accuracy on the training set (90.9%), but performs poorly on the dev set (49.5%) and test set (53.9%). These findings suggest that the model may be overfitting to the training data.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe poor performance on the dev and test sets highlights the importance of using various evaluation metrics beyond accuracy. Normalisation may not be beneficial in this case, given the similar range of features. However, changing the classifier to Linear SGD could potentially improve the model's generalizability. Future work should explore the use of cross-validation, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis study contributes to the understanding of SVMs with SGD in linear classification tasks. Our results suggest that careful experimentation with normalisation and tuning the regularization parameter is crucial for achieving optimal results. Future research should focus on improving the model's generalizability and exploring the use of alternative evaluation metrics.\n\n**Future Work:**\n\nFuture studies should:"], "idxs": [188, 96], "new_tokens": [513, 515], "wall_time": [16.44008493423462, 8.641664266586304]}], "tstamp": 1752308488.1425228}

Here's a suggested approach using C code:\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nTo demonstrate a stack-based buffer overflow exploit, you can use the following example:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid vuln_function(char *string) {\n    char buffer[20];\n    strcpy(buffer, string);\n    printf(\"Received string: %s\\n\", buffer);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    vuln_function(\"A\" * 1000); // overflow buffer\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**\n\n1.  Explain the concept of a stack and its layout in memory.\n2.  Describe how functions are called and how stack frames are created.\n3.  Explain how the buffer overflow occurs in the `vuln_function`.\n4.  Show how the input string `\"A\" * 1000` exceeds the buffer size of `20` bytes.\n5.  Demonstrate how the extra input overflows into the return address on the stack.\n6.  Explain how the attacker can redirect the program flow to their chosen address (e.g., a shell or malicious code).\n\n**Exploitation with Shell Code**\n\nTo make the exploit more interactive, you can use a shell code that prints out a message when executed:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid vuln_function(char *string) {\n    char buffer[20];\n    strcpy(buffer, string);\n    printf(\"Received string: %s\\n\", buffer);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    vuln_function(\"A\" * 1000 \"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x68\\x3a\\x2f\\x2f\\x89\\xe3\\x99\\xb0\\x0b\\xb3\\x01\\xcd\\x80\"); // overflow buffer with shell code\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Prevention**\n\nNow, let's discuss how to prevent stack-based buffer overflows:\n\n1.  **Bounds checking**: Always check the length of the input data before copying it to the buffer.\n    *   `size_t len = strlen(input_string); if (len > 20) { /* handle error */ }`\n2.  **Safe string functions**: Use `strncpy` or `strcpy_s` instead of `strcpy` to prevent buffer overflows.\n    *   `strncpy(buffer,", "Here's an example of vulnerable C code that demontrates a stack-based buffer overflow:\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 20\n\nvoid process_input(char *input) {\n    char buffer[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];\n    strcpy(buffer, input); // Vulnerable to buffer overflow\n    printf(\"Received input: %s\\n\", buffer);\n    if (!strcmp(buffer, \"secret\")) {\n        printf(\"Access granted!\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Invalid input\\n\");\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Enter your input: \");\n    char input[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];\n    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);\n    process_input(input);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The `process_input` function takes a `char*` input, which is a pointer to a character array.\n*   The input is copied into the `buffer` array using `strcpy`, which does not check the length of the input.\n*   If the user enters a string longer than `MAX_INPUT_SIZE`, the extra characters will overflow the `buffer` array and potentially overwrite the return address on the stack.\n*   This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Secure Code Changes:**\n\nTo make the code secure, make the following changes:\n\n1.  **Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`:**\n    *   `strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);` // Add a buffer for the null-terminator\n2.  **Check the input length:**\n    *   `size_t len = strlen(input); if (len >= MAX_INPUT_SIZE) { printf(\"Input too long!\\n\"); return; }`\n3.  **Remove the `'\\n'` character at the end of the input:**\n    *   `input[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';` // Remove the newline character\n\n**Secure Code:**\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 20\n\nvoid process_input(char *input) {\n    char buffer[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];\n    size_t len = strlen(input);\n    if (len >= MAX_INPUT_SIZE) {\n        printf(\"Input too long!\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n    input[len] = '\\0'; // Null-terminate the input"], "idxs": [132, 105], "new_tokens": [513, 515], "wall_time": [11.509708404541016, 9.368180513381958]}], "tstamp": 1752308525.2306762}

The error \"list is not a valid object\" with the suggestion \"it should be a sublist object\" might be due to several reasons.\n\nHere are a few possible scenarios:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Data Type:** Make sure that the variable you are trying to access is indeed a list. You can check this using the `isinstance()` function in many programming languages.\n\n    ```python\n# Python example\nif not isinstance(the_list, list):\n    raise ValueError(\"Variable is not a list\")\n```\n\n2.  **Accessing a Non-Existent Index:** It's possible that you're trying to access an index in the list that doesn't exist.\n\n    ```python\n# Python example\nindex = 5\nif index >= len(the_list):\n    raise IndexError(\"List index is out of range\")\n```\n\n3.  **Modifying a List with an Immutable Method:** Some list methods like `list()` modify the original list, which might be what's causing the \"invalid object\" error if you're trying to use an immutable interface. Lists cannot be \"invalid objects;\" they are inherently a type of object representing a collection of values.\n\n    ```python\nfrom types import SimpleNamespace\n\n# Create an immutable object using SimpleNamespace\nunmodifiable_list = SimpleNamespace(values=[1, 2, 3])\n\n# Trying to modify will not create a list object error.\nunmodifiable_list.values = 4\n```\n\n4.  **Attached Permissions or Execution Issues:** Depending on the execution environment or attached permissions of the code you are running, there may be another associated issue because of security restrictions in belonging apparatus that a built-in item doesn't have inherent capability.\n\nIf none of the above possible reasons sound like a valid explanation for your situation, provide more information about your data type and the operation you're performing.", "You're facing issues with displaying a large number of search results or wanting to add more pages to a sales order search functionality.\n\nHere are general steps on how to enhance a sales order search feature:\n\n### Using Pagination for a Large Number of Results\n\n1.  **Establish a Page Size Limitation:** Set a default page size limit, such as 50 or 100, which will be used when you don't explicitly define it. This helps avoid overwhelming the user with too many items.\n\n    ```javascript\nlet pageSize = 50;\n```\n\n2.  **page = request?.query?.page || 1:** Get the current page number from the URL query or default to page 1.\n\n    ```javascript\nlet page = Number(request.query.page) || 1;\n```\n\n3.  **Add Number of Pages and Pages Navigation:** Determine the number of pages you have by dividing the total number of results by your page size, rounding up if there's a remainder.\n\n    ```javascript\nlet totalPages = Math.ceil(results.length / pageSize);\n```\n\n4.  **Filtering the Results for a Specific Page:** Actually, filter results with your current page's numbers.\n\n    ```javascript\nlet resultsForPage = results.slice((page - 1) * pageSize, page * pageSize);\n```\n\nFor example in express.js\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.get('/search', (req, res) => {\nlet pageSize = 50;\nlet page = Number(req.query.page) || 1;\nlet results =\u03b9\u03c7eterssales.order.search(req.query.searchparameter);\nlet totalPages = Math.ceil(results.length / pageSize);\nlet resultsForPage = results.slice((page - 1) * pageSize, page * pageSize);\n```\n\n### Displaying More Page Numbers and the Previous and Next Buttons:\n\n1.  **Round to a certain number of digits:** Depending on the interface, sometimes you need to effectively imwhether `1000` is indeed a simple page number. \u2200\n\n    ```javascript\ndigits = totalPageNumbers.toString()\n```\n\n2.  **generate the pages navs with 30 digits**\n\n    ```javascript\nlet pagesNav = []edges of details[];\n\nfor (let i = page - Math.floor(Math.max(page - 1, 1)) / 2: 1; i <= page + Math.floor(Math.max(0, totalPages - page)) / 2; i++)\n{\n  let cssClass;\n  let isCurrent = false;\n\n  if (i"], "idxs": [114, 154], "new_tokens": [386, 514], "wall_time": [9.939468383789062, 13.511451721191406]}], "tstamp": 1752308689.1712458}

It's a variant of the transformer architecture, which was first introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Bert works:\n\n1. **Training**: Bert is trained on a large corpus of text data, such as books, articles, or websites. The model is trained to predict masked words in a sentence, which helps it learn contextual relationships between words.\n\n2. **Encoder**: Bert uses a bidirectional encoder, which means it reads the input text both forward and backward. This allows the model to capture both left-to-right and right-to-left contextual relationships.\n\n3. **Self-Attention**: Bert uses self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sentence when making predictions.\n\n4. **Multitask Learning**: Bert is trained on several tasks simultaneously, including:\n\n    * **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: The model is trained to predict the missing word in a sentence, based on the context provided by the surrounding words.\n    * **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: The model is trained to predict whether two sentences are adjacent in the original text.\n\n5. **Pre-training**: Bert is pre-trained on large amounts of text data, which allows it to learn general representations of words and phrases. These pre-trained representations can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks.\n\n6. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained Bert model can be fine-tuned on a specific task, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or text classification. This involves adding a task-specific head to the pre-trained model and training it on the task-specific data.\n\nBert's innovations, such as its use of bidirectional context and self-attention mechanisms, have made it a state-of-the-art model in many natural language processing tasks.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that Bert is a pre-training model. Which means that the main idea is to train it on large amount of data (Pre-training) and then fine-tune it on specific smaller set of data to produce a task-specific outcome. This way it can learn the general knowledge and apply it on more abstract but simpler tasks.", "Here's an analogy to help understand Bert:\n\n**Imagine a library with a vast collection of books**\n\n* **Training data is like building the library**: Just as a library contains thousands of books, the training data for Bert contains a vast corpus of text. The more data, the better the library becomes.\n* **Bert is like a super-smart librarian**: When you ask Bert to predict a missing word or understand the meaning of a sentence, it's like asking the librarian to find a specific book on the shelf. Bert has read all the books in the library (trained on the data) and has developed a deep understanding of the relationships between words and concepts.\n* **Self-attention is like consulting the catalog**: When Bert is processing a sentence, it's like consulting the catalog (self-attention) to see which books (words) might be relevant to the task at hand. This helps it weigh the importance of each word and make informed predictions.\n* **Pre-training is like indexing the catalog**: Before Bert can efficiently find books (make predictions), it needs to index the catalog (pre-train on large amounts of data). This allows it to quickly locate relevant information and make accurate predictions.\n* **Fine-tuning is like searching for a specific book**: Once Bert has mastered the catalog (pre-trained), it can be fine-tuned to focus on specific tasks, like finding a book on a particular topic (sentiment analysis or question answering).\n\nThis analogy helps illustrate how Bert's pre-training and fine-tuning processes work together to enable it to learn and make accurate predictions on various natural language processing tasks."], "idxs": [94, 67], "new_tokens": [472, 326], "wall_time": [8.271008014678955, 6.1999077796936035]}], "tstamp": 1752308774.6537077}

The `Solution` class has a public field `memo` to store the memoized results of subproblems.\n2. The `longestCommonSubsequence` method initializes the `memo` table with a 2D array of size `n x m`, where `n` is the length of `text1` and `m` is the length of `text2`. It then calls the `dfs` method with the top-left corner of the `memo` table.\n3. The `dfs` method takes three parameters: `i`, `j`, and the two input strings `t1` and `t2`. It uses mode recursion to explore the possible subsequences.\n4. If `i` is equal to the length of `t1` or `j` is equal to the length of `t2`, it returns 0, as there are no more characters to compare.\n5. If the result of a subproblem is already memoized (`memo[i][j]!= -1`), it returns the stored result instead of recalculating it.\n6. If `t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)`, it means the current characters match, and the recursive call is made with `i+1` and `j+1` to move to the next characters.\n7. If `t1.charAt(i)!= t2.charAt(j)`, it means the current characters do not match, and the recursive calls are made with `i+1` and `j` (ignore `t1.charAt(i)`), and `i` and `j+1` (ignore `t2.charAt(j)`).\n8. The result of each recursive call is compared using `Math.max` to find the maximum length of the LCS.\n9. Finally, the memoized result is stored in the `memo` table, and it is returned.\n\n**Optimization:**\n\nThe code uses memoization to store the results of subproblems, which reduces the time complexity from exponential to polynomial (O(n \\* m)).\n\nHowever, the code can be further optimized by considering the following points:\n\n* In the current implementation, the", "Here's the updated code that prints the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) string:\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public String longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {\n        int n = text1.length();\n        int m = text2.length();\n\n        // Initialize memoization table\n        int[][] memo = new int[n + 1][m + 1];\n\n        // Initialize result string\n        StringBuilder lcsString = new StringBuilder();\n\n        // Fill memoization table\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {\n                    memo[i][j] = memo[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;\n                } else {\n                    memo[i][j] = Math.max(memo[i - 1][j], memo[i][j - 1]);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Backtrack to construct the LCS string\n        int i = n;\n        int j = m;\n        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {\n            if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {\n                lcsString.insert(0, text1.charAt(i - 1));\n                i--;\n                j--;\n            } else if (memo[i - 1][j] > memo[i][j - 1]) {\n                i--;\n            } else {\n                j--;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return lcsString.toString();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Solution solution = new Solution();\n        String text1 = \"AGGTAB\";\n        String text2 = \"GXTXAYB\";\n        System.out.println(\"LCS string: \" + solution.longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, I made the following changes:\n\n* I replaced the `dfs` method with a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill the memoization table.\n* I added a `StringBuilder` to store the LCS string character by character.\n* I added a `while` loop to backtrack and construct the LCS string.\n* I updated the main method to print the LCS string."], "idxs": [87, 71], "new_tokens": [513, 483], "wall_time": [7.7679831981658936, 6.5613791942596436]}], "tstamp": 1752308912.7847357}

It seems like you're trying to use a caching mechanism, which typically involves functions such as `getFromCache` and `saveToCache`.\n\nHere is a possible mode of how getFromCache function executes:\n\n Inside `content.js` file or in a separate caching file:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getFromCache(cacheName, storageKey) {\n  return async () => {\n    const cache = await storage.load(storageKey);\n    return cache;\n  };\n}\n```\nOr you may be trying to use `chrome.storage` API:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getFromCache(cacheName, storageKey) {\n  return async () => {\n    const data = await chrome.storage.local.get(storageKey);\n    return data;\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAfter adding or modifying the `getFromCache` function, make sure you're correctly calling it in the scope where you're experiencing the error.\n\nTo further investigate, please share more details about your content script, popup/popup.html file, and any relevant code that might be related to this error. This will allow us to provide more specific guidance and help you resolve the issue.", "However, I need to clarify that we won't be able to create a fully working popup.js file without knowing the specifics of your project requirements.

Log in to the AWS Management Console.\n2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.\n3. Click on \"Launch Instance\" and select the desired operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).\n4. Choose the instance type (e.g., t2.micro).\n5. Set up the security group to allow inbound traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., 8080 for HTTP).\n\n**Step 2: Create a new EC2 key pair**\n\n1. Go to the \"Key Pairs\" section in the EC2 dashboard.\n2. Click on \"Create key pair\".\n3. Enter a name for the key pair and download the `.pem` file.\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the EC2 instance**\n\n1. Use a tool like SSH (e.g., `ssh -i path-to-key-pair.pem ec2-user@EC2-INSTANCE-IPv4`).\n2. Once logged in, update the package list and install Node.js (e.g., `sudo yum update -y && sudo yum install -y nodejs`).\n\n**Step 4: Deploy the Node.js service**\n\n1. Create a new directory for the service (e.g., `sudo mkdir -p /home/ec2-user/service`).\n2. Create a new file for the service (e.g., `sudo nano /home/ec2-user/service/index.js`).\n3. Write the Node.js code (e.g., `const http = require('http'); http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); res.end('Hello World\\n'); }).listen(8080, '0.0.0.0');`).\n4. Save and close the file.\n5. Make the service executable (e.g., `sudo chmod +x /home/ec2-user/service/index.js`).\n6. Start the service (e.g., `sudo node /home/ec2-user/service/index.js`).\n\n**Step 5: Configure a process manager (optional)**\n\nTo ensure the service stays running after a restart, you can set up a process manager like PM2.\n\n1. Install PM2 (e.g., `sudo npm install pm2 -g`).\n2. Create a new configuration file for PM2 (e.g., `sudo nano /home/ec2-user/pm2.config`).\n3.", "To replace a single EC2 instance with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), you'll need to make the following changes:\n\n**Changes to the EC2 instance setup:**\n\n1.

High availability: If one instance becomes unhealthy or is terminated, the ELB will automatically route traffic to the remaining instances.\n2. Scale-out and scale-in: As traffic increases, the ELB can automatically scale out to add more instances, and as traffic decreases, it can scale in to reduce costs.\n3.

It's used to predict how long an algorithm will take to complete as the input size (n) increases. Here are the key concepts of Big O notation, explained in simple terms, along with examples:\n\n1. **Constant Time Complexity (O(1))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes the same time regardless of the input size. Think of it like looking up a word in a dictionary. You still find the answer in the same time, whether the word is on page 1 or 1000.\n\nExample: Accessing an element in an array by its index.\n\n```python\ndef print_square_root(array, index):\n    return array[index]\n```\n\n2. **Linear Time Complexity (O(n))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes time proportional to the input size. Think of it like counting from 1 to n. It takes longer as n gets bigger.\n\nExample: Finding the sum of all elements in an array.\n\n```python\ndef sum_array(array):\n    total = 0\n    for num in array:\n        total += num\n    return total\n```\n\n3. **Logarithmic Time Complexity (O(log n))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size. Think of it like dividing a list of numbers in half until you find the answer. It's faster than linear time complexity.\n\nExample: Finding an element in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(array, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if array[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif array[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return -1  # Not found\n```\n\n4. **Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n^2))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes time proportional to the square of the input size. Think of it like two nested loops. It's much slower than linear time complexity.\n\nExample: Finding all pairs of elements in an array that sum up to a target value.\n\n```python\ndef find_pairs(array, target):\n    pairs = []\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):\n            if array", "Big O notation is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, which is essentially a set of steps or instructions to solve a problem. It's used to predict how long an algorithm will take to complete as the input size (n) increases. Here are the key concepts of Big O notation, explained in simple terms, along with Python code snippets and examples:\n\n1. **Constant Time Complexity (O(1))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes the same time regardless of the input size. Think of it like looking up a word in a dictionary. You still find the answer in the same time, whether the word is on page 1 or 1000.\n\nExample: Accessing an element in an array by its index.\n\n```python\ndef print_square_root(array, index):\n    return array[index]\n\n# Test the function\narray = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nindex = 2\nresult = print_square_root(array, index)\nprint(f\"The square root of {array[index]} is {result}\")\n\n# Output: The square root of 9 is 3\n```\n\n2. **Linear Time Complexity (O(n))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes time proportional to the input size. Think of it like counting from 1 to n. It takes longer as n gets bigger.\n\nExample: Finding the sum of all elements in an array.\n\n```python\ndef sum_array(array):\n    total = 0\n    for num in array:\n        total += num\n    return total\n\n# Test the function\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_array(array)\nprint(f\"The sum of the array is {result}\")\n\n# Output: The sum of the array is 15\n```\n\n3. **Logarithmic Time Complexity (O(log n))**\n\nThis means the algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size. Think of it like dividing a list of numbers in half until you find the answer. It's faster than linear time complexity.\n\nExample: Finding an element in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(array, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if array[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif array[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid"], "idxs": [83, 63], "new_tokens": [513, 514], "wall_time": [7.317028045654297, 5.769604921340942]}], "tstamp": 1752309040.9371595}

Here are the instructions you requested:\n\n**Step 1: Install Node.js and the required packages**\n\nYou need to have Node.js installed on your OS. If you don't have it, download and install it from the official Node.js website: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>\n\nOnce you have Node.js installed, open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project. Install the required packages using npm (Node Package Manager):\n\n```bash\n# Create a new folder and navigate into it\nmkdir simple-rest-server\ncd simple-rest-server\n\n# Create a new folder for your project files\nmkdir src\n\n# Navigate into the src folder\ncd src\n\n# Create a new file called server.js\ntouch server.js\n\n# Install the required package (express.js)\nnpm init -y\nnpm install express\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create the server**\n\nIn the `server.js` file, add the following code:\n\n```javascript\n// Import the express package\nconst express = require('express');\n\n// Create a new express application\nconst app = express();\n\n// Set the port to 8080\nconst port = 8080;\n\n// Define a JSON template for the GET request\nconst template = {\n  id: 1,\n  sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n  choices: {\n    relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n    quantity: ['few','some','many']\n  }\n};\n\n// Define a function to process the POST request payload\nconst processPayload = (req, res) => {\n  console.log(req.body); // Print the payload to the standard output\n  res.status(200).send({}); // Respond with a 200 HTTP response code\n};\n\n// Handle the GET request to the /template URL\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(template);\n});\n\n// Handle the POST request to the /response URL\napp.post('/response', express.json(), (req, res) => {\n  processPayload(req, res);\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n**Step 3: Start the server**\n\nTo start the server, navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnode src/server.js\n```\n\nThe server will start and listen on port 8080. You can", "The error you're seeing is due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. When making requests from a web page (in your case, `http://localhost:3000`), the browser will automatically add an \"Origin\" header to the request, and if the server doesn't include a matching \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header in the response, the browser will block the request.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to add CORS support to your server. In Node.js, you can do this using the `cors` package. Add it to your project with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install cors\n```\n\nThen, in your `server.js` file, add the following code to enable CORS:\n\n```javascript\n// Import the express and cors packages\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\n// Create a new express application\nconst app = express();\n\n// Set the port to 8080\nconst port = 8080;\n\n// Define a JSON template for the GET request\nconst template = {\n  id: 1,\n  sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n  choices: {\n    relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n    quantity: ['few','some','many']\n  }\n};\n\n// Define a function to process the POST request payload\nconst processPayload = (req, res) => {\n  console.log(req.body); // Print the payload to the standard output\n  res.status(200).send({}); // Respond with a 200 HTTP response code\n};\n\n// Enable CORS\nlet corsOptions = {\n  origin: '*', // Allow requests from all origins\n  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,\n  methods: ['GET', 'POST']\n};\napp.use(cors(corsOptions));\n\n// Handle the GET request to the /template URL\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(template);\n});\n\n// Handle the POST request to the /response URL\napp.post('/response', express.json(), (req, res) => {\n  processPayload(req, res);\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nIn the code above, we've added the `corsOptions` object to define the CORS settings, and then used the `app.use()` method to enable CORS for our server. This should allow requests from any origin (set by the `origin` property of `corsOptions`) and allow GET and POST requests ("], "idxs": [82, 93], "new_tokens": [516, 515], "wall_time": [7.295591592788696, 8.40359377861023]}], "tstamp": 1752309213.4052536}

Let's break it down:\n\n1. `self.conv1 = `: This line is defining a new instance of a GCN layer, assigning it to an attribute called `conv1` within a class (indicated by `self`).\n2. `GCNConv(`: `GCNConv` is a type of neural network layer commonly used for graph-structured data. It's a variant of the conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers used in image classification tasks, but adapted for graph data.\n3. `input_shape[1] + 1`: This is the input dimension to this GCN layer. Here's what it means:\n\t* `input_shape`: It's likely an attribute of the class that contains information about the network's input shape.\n\t* `[1]`: It seems to be indexing the second dimension of the input shape (assuming the input shape is a list or array).\n\t* `+ 1`: This is adding 1 to the second dimension of the input shape, which might suggest that an additional input or dimension is being added, possibly for a bias term or an extra feature.\n4. `num_filters`: This is the number of filters (or channels) in the GCN layer. In other words, it's the output dimension of this layer.\n\nSo, the line of code can be interpreted as: \"Define a GCN layer (`conv1`) that takes input data with `input_shape[1] + 1` dimensions and produces output data with `num_filters` dimensions.\"\n\nHere's a simple analogy to help visualize this:\n\nImagine a CNN layer for image classification. The input is a 3D image (height, width, color channels). The CNN layer might take the 3D image as input, apply some filters to extract features (like edges or textures), and produce a 2D output (feature maps). In this analogy, `input_shape[1]` would be the number of color channels (3), and adding 1 might represent an additional output dimension for a bias term. The `num_filters` would be the number of feature maps produced by the CNN layer.\n\nSimilarly, the GCN layer in the code might be working on graph-structured data, where each node has connections to its neighbors. The input data would have a specific dimensionality, and the GCN layer would apply filters to extract features from the graph, producing an output with `num", "The difference lies in the input dimension calculation:\n\n1. `input_shape[1] + 1`: This suggests that an additional dimension or feature is being added to the input, possibly for a bias term, a constant value, or an extra feature. The `+ 1` indicates that the input shape is being augmented with an extra dimension.\n2. `input_shape[1] + edge_features`: This is different, as `edge_features` implies that we're considering additional information from the edges (or connections) in the graph, rather than just adding a fixed value.\n\nIn other words, when you use `input_shape[1] + edge_features`:\n\n* You're incorporating the features associated with each edge in the graph, not just the input data itself.\n* This allows the GCN layer to capture information about how nodes are connected, potentially capturing more complex relationships and patterns in the data.\n\nThis is in contrast to using `input_shape[1] + 1`, where you're simply adding an extra dimension without considering the graph's edge features.\n\nTo illustrate the difference:\n\n* Suppose your graph has nodes representing people, and edges representing friendships.

Many alleged claims of \"free energy\" involve flawed or misleading concepts, such as overunity systems or claims of energy perpetuity without energy source flows.\n\nTherefore, I'm unable to provide a realistic timeframe for \"free energy disclosure\" because it does not align with the current scientific understanding of energy and the laws of physics. \n\nHowever, research continues on alternative and renewable energy sources, such as advanced nuclear reactors, fusion energy, and innovative solar technologies, that can make a significant impact on global energy markets.\n\nIf you have any other questions about existing or developing energy technologies, I'll do my best to provide you with accurate and unbiased information."], "idxs": [40, 62], "new_tokens": [230, 197], "wall_time": [3.612267017364502, 5.562962293624878]}], "tstamp": 1752309437.660632}

Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. **Data Loading**: It loads the Iris dataset using `load_iris()` from scikit-learn. The Iris dataset is a multi-class classification problem, consisting of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).\n\n2. **Data Split**: It splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing sets (20%) using `train_test_split()`.\n\n3. **Model Training**: It trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) model on the training data using `fit()`. Naive Bayes is a family of algorithms that belong to the supervised learning category, and a Gaussian Naive Bayes model assumes that each feature mode follows a normal distribution.\n\n4. **Prediction**: It uses the trained model to predict the class labels on the test data using `predict()`.\n\n5. **Model Evaluation**: It calculates the accuracy of the model on the test data using `accuracy_score()`. The accuracy measures how well the model performs against the actual labels.\n\n6. **Confusion Matrix**: It creates a confusion matrix, which is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The matrix lists the actual classes versus predicted classes.\n\n7. **Visualization**: Finally, it uses Seaborn's `heatmap()` function and Matplotlib's `show()` function to visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap, where the table is represented as a grid of data.\n\nThe code seems to be a simple example of how to use Naive Bayes for classification, and it includes some basic metrics like accuracy and a visualization of the confusion matrix. \n\nHowever, please note that the usage of Gaussian Naive Bayes might not be the best choice here because it assumes that the input features are normally distributed. Iris dataset, though being a well-known dataset, does indeed contain features that may not be perfectly normally distributed, which may not be the best fit for this algorithm. \n\nThe code is readable and well-structured, with proper naming conventions used for variables. The Seaborn heatmap should help to visually identify any class imbalances, misclassifications, etc.", "**Confusion Matrix**\n\nA confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It's used to compare the predicted classes with the actual classes in a dataset. The main purpose of a confusion matrix is to help diagnose where a model is making mistakes or accurately predicting items. The rows represent the correct classes and the columns represent the predicted classes.\n\nHere's a basic breakdown of the confusion matrix:\n\n|  | Predicted Class A | Predicted Class B | Predicted Class C |... |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |... |\n| **Actual Class A** | True Positives (TP) | False Positives (FP) | False Negatives (FN) |... |\n| **Actual Class B** | False Negatives (FN) | True Negatives (TN) | False Positives (FP) |... |\n| **Actual Class C** | False Negatives (FN) | False Negatives (FN) | True Negatives (TN) |... |\n|... |... |... |... |... |\n\nSome important terms to understand in the confusion matrix:\n\n*   **True Positives (TP)**: When the model predicts the class correctly (e.g., Predicted A, Actual A).\n*   **True Negatives (TN)**: When the model correctly predicts that a class is not present (e.g., Predicted not A, Actual not A).\n*   **False Positives (FP)**: When the model predicts a class incorrectly (e.g., Predicted B, Actual A).\n*   **False Negatives (FN)**: When the model fails to predict a class (e.g., Predicted not B, Actual B).\n\n**Heatmap**\n\nHeatmaps are used to visualize data with high dimensional matrices and promote quick understanding of complex data by focusing on the most important points. They're commonly used when dealing with categorical or numerical data that is spread across a large matrix.\n\nIn the context of a confusion matrix, a heatmap uses colors to represent the distribution of data across the matrix. The following is the explanations of values you might see in a confusion matrix heatmap:\n\n*   **White or light-blue (TP):** A 1 (When the model predicts correctly)\n*   **Red (FN):** A 0 (When the model fails to predict an instance from the class i.e False Negatives).\n*   **Blue (TN):** A 0 (When correctly predicted potential classes are false predictions only and in a broader term sometimes called True Negative)\n*   **Green (FP"], "idxs": [96, 121], "new_tokens": [461, 519], "wall_time": [8.474017143249512, 10.701169967651367]}], "tstamp": 1752309556.9634871}

This is typically indicated by a `-` character followed by the word `stdin` in the command. For example, in the case of SSH, you can use `ssh -pass` option.\n\n2. **Use an environment variable**: You can store passwords securely in an environment variable.

Some of the advantages of having healthy muscle include:\n\n1. **Improved Strength and Endurance**: Building muscle mass helps increase physical strength and endurance, making everyday activities like lifting groceries or climbing stairs easier.\n2. **Weight Management**: Muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain than fat tissue, which can help boost metabolism and aid in weight loss.\n3. **Enhanced Bone Density**: Resistance exercise, which helps build muscle, also stimulates bone growth, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\n4. **Better Posture**: Well-toned muscles in the back, core, and legs help maintain good posture, reducing the risk of back pain and other musculoskeletal issues.\n5. **Improved Joint Health**: Strong muscles around the joints help distribute weight and stress more evenly, reducing the risk of injury and degenerative conditions like arthritis.\n6. **Increased Metabolism**: As muscle mass increases, so does the resting metabolic rate, helping the body burn calories at a faster pace.\n7. **Better Mental Health**: Exercise and muscle-building activities have been linked to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression levels.\n8. **Improved Athletic Performance**: Muscle strength and endurance can enhance performance in various sports and physical activities.\n9. **Enhanced Immune Function**: Studies have shown that muscle mass is positively correlated with immune function, helping the body fight off infections and diseases.\n\nOverall, having well-toned muscles can have lasting benefits for both physical and mental health.", "Let's break down each of the advantages of having healthy muscle tissue:\n\n1. **Improved Strength and Endurance**\n\nHaving strong muscles helps you perform daily activities with ease, whether it's carrying groceries or lifting your children. When you build muscle, you're not just adding bulk; you're also increasing your muscle's capacity to generate force, which enables you to perform more complex movements.\n\nExercise-induced muscle growth, particularly in older adults, has been shown to improve muscle function and quality. Resistance training can increase muscle strength, which is essential for independence in daily life and athletic performance.\n\n2. **Weight Management**\n\nMuscle tissue requires more energy to maintain than fat tissue. The more muscle mass you have, the higher your resting metabolic rate (RMR), which is the number of calories your body burns at rest. This means that your body will burn more calories, even when you're not exercising.\n\nA higher RMR helps you maintain weight loss over time, but this is not a free pass to be sedentary. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are still essential for maintaining weight loss.\n\n3. **Enhanced Bone Density**\n\nResistance training, which is essential for building muscle, also stimulates bone growth. When you engage in weight-bearing exercises, the muscles and bones in your body experience stress, which triggers a response that strengthens them. This process is called loading.\n\nAs muscle and bone integrate with each other, they experience a period of increased growth and remodeling, leading to improved bone density. This helps prevent conditions such as osteoporosis and fractures.\n\n4. **Better Posture**\n\nStrong muscles in the back, core, and legs help you maintain optimal posture. Weak muscles, on the other hand, can lead to a slouched or rounded back. Strengthening your core and surrounding muscle groups helps distribute the weight evenly, putting less pressure on your spine.\n\nMaintaining good posture has numerous benefits, including reduced back pain, improved balance, and enhanced overall movement quality. Moreover, having good posture can enhance athletic performance by decreasing energy waste and improving overall movement economy.\n\n5. **Improved Joint Health**\n\nHaving strong muscles around your joints helps mitigate joint stress and improves joint health. Resistance training targeting specific joints (like breasts) helps:\n\n- Reduce pressure on your joints\n- Distribute stress more evenly across joints\n- Enhance joint movement range and promote range of motion\n- Strengthen the muscles and tendons surrounding your joints\n\nA stronger muscle unit surrounding your joints will not prevent entirely joint wear and tear, but can certainly delay it, as stronger muscles"], "idxs": [52, 128], "new_tokens": [310, 513], "wall_time": [4.6844141483306885, 11.26466155052185]}], "tstamp": 1752309649.8661754}

The `:` in the path pattern is a parameter, meaning that the path can have different values for those parameters. For example, `/mycompany/myproject/myteam` would match this pattern.\n- `v2: '/companies/public-domains'`: This is another path pattern that this rule applies to. This one matches paths that start with `/companies/public-domains` exactly, due to the trailing slashes.\n- `v3: 'POST'`: This specifies the HTTP method (or action) that is being granted permission for. In this case, it's a POST request.\n\nSo, putting it all together, this policy means: \"An admin user can perform a POST request on any path that matches either the path pattern '/:company/:project/:team' or the path pattern '/companies/public-domains'\".\n\nHowever, a more accurate explanation would be:\n\n\"This policy grants a POST action to an admin role user for specific paths, either /company/:project/:team or /companies/public-domains.\n\nThe way Casbin works, though, typically it can refer roles for subjects (users), or rules specific to identities (making for ACLs as a better fit for belonging roles to users).

Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Product Placement**: This involves incorporating a product into a movie, TV show, or video game without explicitly promoting it. For example, a coffee cup from a specific brand might appear in a TV show or a character might use a laptop from a particular brand.\n2. **Sponsorship**: Sponsoring events, teams, or individuals can be a form of non-intrusive advertising. For instance, a sports team might be sponsored by a brewery, and the brewery's logo might appear on the team's jerseys.\n3. **Native Advertising**: This type of advertising blends in with the content it's associated with. Online content, like a Facebook post or an article on a blog, might include a \"sponsored content\" label, but the content itself is designed to look like regular content.\n4. **Experiential Marketing**: Experiential marketing involves creating immersive experiences for consumers, such as events, pop-up shops, or interactive installations. These experiences often incorporate branded elements, such as merchandise or messaging, without feeling intrusive.\n5. **Licensing**: Branding a product or service and licensing it for use in a specific context can be a form of non-intrusive advertising. For example, a brand might license its logo or character to be used on a specific product or service.\n6. **Content Integration**: This involves integrating branded content into existing media formats, such as a brand-created video within a YouTube video or a podcast.\n7. **Point-of-Purchase Displays**: Placing product displays or promotional materials in strategic locations can be an effective form of non-intrusive advertising. For example, a shelf display might feature a particular brand's products in a store.\n8. **User-Generated Content**: Encouraging customers to create content featuring a brand or product can be a low-key form of advertising. For instance, a brand might ask customers to share photos or videos of themselves using a product on social media.\n\nRemember that while non-intrusive advertising can be effective, it's essential to ensure that the advertising is not misleading or deceptive.

Here are some techniques to apply nudges when designing in-app ads:\n\n1. **Visibility and Placement**: Position the ad in a way that makes sense within the context of the app and the user's current workflow. Use visuals and whitespace effectively to draw attention to the ad without overwhelming the user.\n2. **Gradual Disclosure**: Reveal the ad in a gentle, non-disruptive manner, such as by expanding a panel or smooth animation. Avoid abrupt animations or banners that might feel intrusive.\n3. **Engagement through Interaction**: Use interactive elements, like hover effects, text input, or pull-to-refresh, to engage the user and create a sense of curiosity.\n4. **Gamification and Feedback**: Incorporate gamification elements, like stars, badges, or score counters, and immediate feedback (e.g., animations, sound effects) to make interaction more enjoyable and rewarding.\n5. **Guidance through Accessibility**: Use accessibility features like screen readers, cursor movement, and keyboard-friendly navigation to ensure the ad is usable for all users.\n6. **Skim-relevant Content**: Craft ad content that relates to the user's actual behavior or intent. For instance, an e-commerce app might show ads related to items the user has browsed before.\n7. **Attractiveness and Credibility**: Make the ad visually appealing and trustworthy by using:\n\t* Clear typography and imagery\n\t* Relevant and recognizable branding\n\t* Trust badges, like ratings or customer testimonials\n8. **Pilot and Incremental Feedback**: Design the ad in small increments, gather user feedback, and make iterative adjustments. Monitor user behavior (e.g., click-through rates, views) and adjust the design accordingly.\n9. **Consistency and Familiarity**: Design the ad to resonate with the app's overall aesthetic and feel.

You can use it to create resources and collections.\n\n2. **Pintrest-Mode Version of Flask_API**: You could take look at Flask API.", "Go's generics feature is indeed useful for simplifying code.\n\nIn the context of a REST framework, a generic resource struct or function can help reduce boilerplate code. Here's an idea:\n\n**Generic Resource Struct**\n\nYou can define a generic struct that accepts a type `T` as a parameter, where `T` is the type of the resource. This struct can contain methods for common resource operations like `Get`, `Post`, `Put`, and `Delete`.\n\n```go\ntype GenericResource[T any] struct {\n\tResources map[string]T\n}\n\nfunc (r *GenericResource[T]) Get(id string) (T, error) {\n\t// Implement Get logic\n}\n\nfunc (r *GenericResource[T]) Post(item T) (T, error) {\n\t// Implement Post logic\n}\n\nfunc (r *GenericResource[T]) Put(id string, item T) (T, error) {\n\t// Implement Put logic\n}\n\nfunc (r *GenericResource[T]) Delete(id string) error {\n\t// Implement Delete logic\n}\n```\n\n**Generic Resource Function**\n\nAlternatively, you can define a generic function that takes a type `T` as a parameter and returns a function that can handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n\n```go\nfunc NewGenericResource[T any]() func(string,...string) (T, error) {\n\treturn func(id string, method, id belonging) (T, error) {\n\t\tswitch method {\n\t\tcase \"get\":\n\t\t\t// Implement Get logic\n\t\tcase \"post\":\n\t\t\t// Implement Post logic\n\t\tcase \"put\":\n\t\t\t// Implement Put logic\n\t\tcase \"delete\":\n\t\t\t// Implement Delete logic\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"method not supported\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can then create a resource instance by calling `NewGenericResource[type]()` and use it to handle CRUD operations.\n\nThese ideas should help you simplify resource handling in your REST framework.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\nSuppose you have a `Book` struct and want to create a `Book` resource:\n```go\ntype Book struct {\n\tTitle string\n\tAuthor string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tbookResource := NewGenericResource[Book]()\n\tbook, err := bookResource(\"get\", \"books/1\")\n\tif err!= nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println(book)\n}\n```\nNote that this is a simplified example to illustrate the concept.

We define a `load_hierarchy` function to load the hierarchy from a JSON file using `json.load`.\n2. The function includes error handling for file not found and JSON decoding errors.\n3. We use a `main` function to demonstrate how to load the hierarchy and print its contents.\n4. We use a try-except block to handle potential errors when loading the hierarchy.\n5. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard ensures the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Save this code to a file named `load_hierarchy.py`.\n2. Create a JSON file named `skeleton.hierarchy` in the same directory, with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n    \"node1\": {\n        \"child1\": \"value1\",\n        \"child2\": \"value2\"\n    },\n    \"node2\": {\n        \"child3\": \"value3\",\n        \"child4\": \"value4\"\n    }\n}\n```\n3. Run the `load_hierarchy.py` script using `python load_hierarchy.py`.\n4. The script will print the loaded hierarchy to the console.\n\nThis code assumes the JSON file has a nested dictionary structure, where each key", "Here's the simulated execution of the script with the provided hierarchy:\n\n**File Structure:**\n\n* `load_hierarchy.py` (script)\n* `skeleton.hierarchy` (JSON file)\n\n**Content of `skeleton.hierarchy`:**\n```json\n{\n    \"root\": {\n        \"child1\": \"value1\",\n        \"child2\": \"value2\",\n        \"child3\": {\n            \"grandchild1\": \"value3\",\n            \"grandchild2\": \"value4\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nroot:\n  child1: value1\n  child2: value2\n  child3:\n    grandchild1: value3\n    grandchild2: value4\n```\nHere's the step-by-step execution of the `load_hierarchy` function:\n\n1. The script loads the `skeleton.hierarchy` file into memory using `json.load`.\n2. The loaded hierarchy is a nested dictionary with the following structure:\n```python\n{\n    'root': {\n        'child1': 'value1',\n        'child2': 'value2',\n        'child3': {\n            'grandchild1': 'value3',\n            'grandchild2': 'value4'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n3. The script iterates through the loaded hierarchy using a recursive approach.\n4. For each key-value pair in the hierarchy, the script prints the key and its corresponding value(s).\n5. If a value is another dictionary, the script recursively prints its contents.\n\nIn this case, the output is:\n```\nroot:\n  child1: value1\n  child2: value2\n  child3:\n    grandchild1: value3\n    grandchild2: value4\n```\nThis output represents the loaded hierarchy in a human-readable format."], "idxs": [74, 57], "new_tokens": [516, 375], "wall_time": [6.577598810195923, 5.270861625671387]}], "tstamp": 1752309771.9124827}

Actuators can be motors, valves, or any other device that provides a physical output.\n\n3. **Sensor** (\u25fc Provides measurement of the controlled system output): A sensor is responsible for measuring the output of the controlled system, providing feedback to the controller about the process parameters. Sensors can measure variables such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, or other process variables.\n\n4. **Reference input (\u25fc Represents the desired value of the controlled system output)**: The reference input is the desired value of the system output, which is set by the system operator or is based on the desired performance criteria.

To add the ability to search by field in a Customer-company code, you would typically need to modify the database schema or the code that generates the search interface.\n\nAssuming you have a database table named \"customers\" or something similar, here's a general outline of how you can add a search functionality:\n\n1. **Database Schema:**\n   If you're using a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, you can add a new column to the table to store indexed search terms. This is still more of an indexing of searches, as shown below.\n\n   ```sql\n   ALTER TABLE customers\n   ADD COLUMN search_dirty VARCHAR(255);\n   ```\n\n   For instance, store the search string as-is or ciphered or hashed.\n\n2. **Search Interface:**\n   When the user enters a search term, you can pass that term to the database and retrieve only the records that match that term. \n\n   This can be achieved using query parameters like the following function.\n\n   ```sql\n   USE SQL:\n       SELECT *\n       FROM customers\n       WHERE customer_name LIKE '%term\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf%\\'\n       AND search_dirty LIKE '%termin%\\'\n   ```\n3. **Dynamic SQL Server stored procedure code:**\n    Here's a code that you can use with asp.net core and entity framework core to make search with a given column.\n   ```csharp\n    public class SearchMethod\n    {\n        public string SearchTerm { get; set; }\n        public string SearchCol { get; set;}\n\n        public string belonging_table\n        {\n            get { return \"customers\"; }\n            set { belonging_table = value; }\n        }\n    }\n    [HttpGet(\"/api/[controller]/search\")]\n    public IActionResult Search(ViewGroup items)\n    {\n        var term = items.SearchTerm;\n        var searchCol = items.SearchCol;\n        var customersRepo = _customerRepo.GetInstance();\n\n        var customers = customersRepo.SearchFor(term, searchCol);\n\n        // now construct your response\n        return Json(customers);\n    }\n```\n\n    ```sql\n    USE ISMININGDB\n    CREATE PROCEDURE sSearchFor \n        @search_string nvarchar(255),\n        @search_col nvarchar(50)\n    AS\n    BEGIN\n    SELECT *\n    FROM customers\n    WHERE @search_col like '%'+@search_string+'%'\n    END\n```\n\nYou would then connect to your \"searchFor\" stored procedure using your", "To establish the relationships between the `Customer_Company`, `Customer_Person`, and `Customer_Meter` tables, you would typically use foreign keys in your database schema.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relationships you described:\n\n1.  `Customer_Company` has a one-to-many relationship with:\n    *   `Customer_Person` (one company can have many employees/persons)\n    *   `Customer_Meter` (one company can have many meters associated with it)\n2.  `Customer_Person` has a many-to-many relationship with:\n    *   `Customer_Meter` (a person can be associated with multiple meters, and a meter can be associated with multiple persons)\n\nTo represent this in your database schema, you would typically have the following tables:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Company (\n    CompanyID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    CompanyName VARCHAR(255),\n    -- Other columns...\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Person (\n    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    CompanyID INT,\n    PersonName VARCHAR(255),\n    -- Other columns...\n    FOREIGN KEY (CompanyID) REFERENCES Customer_Company(CompanyID)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Meter (\n    MeterID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    -- Other columns...\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customer_Meter_Person (\n    PersonID INT,\n    MeterID INT,\n    -- Other columns...\n    PRIMARY KEY (PersonID, MeterID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Customer_Person(PersonID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (MeterID) REFERENCES Customer_Meter(MeterID)\n);\n```\n\nIn the `Customer_Meter_Person` table, you have a composite primary key of `PersonID` and `MeterID`, which represents the many-to-many relationship between a person and a meter.\n\nTo query this data, you would typically use JOINs to link the tables together.\n\nFor example, to get all meters associated with a specific company, you would use a query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT cm.MeterID, cm.MeterName\nFROM Customer_Company cc\nJOIN Customer_Person cp ON cc.CompanyID = cp.CompanyID\nJOIN Customer_Meter cm ON cp.PersonID = cmcp.PersonID\nJOIN Customer_Meter_Person cmp ON cm.MeterID = cmp.MeterID\nWHERE cc.CompanyID = @CompanyID;\n```\n\nI hope this helps clarify the relationships between the tables!

Validating your UVP with real customers and users is crucial before scaling your business.\n\nReid Hoffman emphasizes the importance of understanding your customer acquisition cost (CAC) and user lifetime value (LTV). If you can efficiently acquire customers at a lower CAC and provide a product that significantly improves their LTV, you've got a strong foundation for growth.\n\nElon Musk's approach to product development, as outlined in his b\u00e0nner items, highlights the importance of focusing on a single, key objective:\n\n1. **Make something people want** (validate your UVP)\n2. **Make it better than existing alternatives** (unique value proposition)\n3. **Scale efficiently** (customer acquisition and retention)\n\nMarc Andreessen's famous quote, \"Software is eating the world,\" underscores the importance of developing innovative, technology-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.\n\nTo summarize, the most important thing to focus on is validating your unique value proposition with real customers and users. This will help you create a product that people want, make it better than existing alternatives, and set the foundation for efficient scaling.\n\nHow do you currently validate your UVP, or what challenges are you facing in this area?"], "idxs": [65, 79], "new_tokens": [294, 318], "wall_time": [5.908169507980347, 7.094807386398315]}], "tstamp": 1752309917.5176911}
