Here's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n- You're initializing an SVM classifier with a hinge loss function, which is suitable for binary classification problems where each sample is either 0 or 1 (or in your case, -1 or 1, assuming you're using One-vs-All or One-vs-One strategy since you only provided a binary response here).\n- You're using SGD as the optimization algorithm, which is an iterative method that updates the model parameters at each step using the average of the gradients with respect to the loss function.\n- The `normalise=False` parameter means that the SVM is not normalizing the input features before the classification process.\n- You're evaluating the model using the `predict` method, which is used to make predictions on unseen data. You're providing labels for `y_train`, `y_dev`, and `y_test`, but it seems you're not actually passing them to the `predict` method because the return values don't seem to have anything to do with the labels passed.\n\n**Discussion Point 1: Interpretation of Accuracy Values**\nThe accuracy values you're getting for your model seem fairly low for a binary classification problem. Typically, an SVM with a hinge loss function would achieve much higher accuracy given the right choice of parameters.\n\n**Discussion Point 2: Analysis of Dev and Test Accuracy**\nThe fact that the Dev accuracy (49.4970%) is lower than the Test accuracy (53.8767%) is suspicious because it's unexpected that the model would seem to perform better on the test set than the dev set.\n\n**Potential Improvements**\n\n1.  **Model Selection**: Choose a different optimization algorithm, like 'libsvm' instead of'sgd'.\n2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different values of `alpha` to see if you can improve the model's accuracy.\n3.  **Measuring Overfitting**: Look at the dev accuracy to find signs of overfitting. Model overfitting (when a model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize to other unseen data.) may be the reason Dev accuracy is low, and it may result in a similar underfitting on the test set.\n4.  **Normalization**: Try normalizing the input features before training the SVM to see if it improves the model's accuracy.\n5.  **", "Here's a possible summary for a research paper based on the work we've done so far:\n\n**Title:** Exploration of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Optimization for Binary Classification Tasks\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization for binary classification tasks. Our experiments involved training an SVM classifier with a hinge loss function using the SGD algorithm on a given binary classification dataset. We explored various settings, including the impact of feature normalization and the choice of optimization algorithm. Unfortunately, our results revealed suboptimal performance, with Dev and Test accuracy values of 49.4970% and 53.8767%, respectively, for the well-established binary classification setup.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used classifiers for solving binary classification problems. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm often used to speed up the learning process of SVMs. In this study, we examine the performance of an SVM classifier using the SGD algorithm for binary classification.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nOur experimental protocol involved training an SVM classifier on a given dataset with a hinge loss function using the SGD optimization algorithm. We evaluated the model's performance on the training set, dev set, and test set.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur experimental results demonstrated suboptimal performance, with Dev accuracy of 49.4970% and Test accuracy of 53.8767%. The Training accuracy was reasonable at 90.9000%.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe low accuracy values obtained in this study highlight the need for further investigation into the optimization setup and the training protocol. Several possible improvements are suggested to achieve better results, including trying different optimization algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, our study underscores the importance of considering the optimization setup and training protocol when using SVM classifiers for binary classification tasks. Future work involves exploring other optimization algorithms and hyperparameter settings to achieve better results.\n\nNote that this is a very basic summary, and a full research paper would require more detailed results, analysis, and discussion of the findings, as well as details about the dataset, experimental setup, and other relevant details."], "idxs": [146, 106], "new_tokens": [513, 460], "wall_time": [11.562745809555054, 8.826956748962402]}], "tstamp": 1752402740.7649932}

Here's a suggested approach to introduce this topic using C code examples:\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n* Basic understanding of C programming and assembly language\n* Familiarity with the x86 architecture (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit)\n* A Linux-based system for demonstration and experimentation\n\n**Step 1: Introduction to Stack-Based Buffer Overflows**\n\n* Explain the concept of a stack and how data is stored on the stack\n* Use a simple C program to demonstrate the stack layout, showing how local variables are stored on the stack\n* Introduce the concept of buffer overflows and how they occur when writing data to a buffer exceeds its size\n\n**Example C Code ( overflow.c ):**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid vulnerable_function(char* input) {\n    char buffer[10];\n    strcpy(buffer, input);\n    printf(\"Buffer: %s\\n\", buffer);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    vulnerable_function(\"Hello, World!\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the vulnerable_function() takes a char* input and copies it to a 10-byte buffer using strcpy(). If the input string is longer than 10 bytes, it will overflow the buffer.\n\n**Step 2: Demonstrating Stack-Based Buffer Overflows**\n\n* Compile the overflow.c program using gcc: `gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector overflow.c -o overflow`\n* Run the program with a long input string that will overflow the buffer: `./overflow \"$(printf \"A\"$(printf \"\\\\0%s\" $(od -An -N 10 -tu4 \\\\\\$(n))\"...16384))\"))`\n* Use a debugger like gdb to examine the stack and see the buffer overflow\n* Explain how the buffer overflow occurs and how the stack is corrupted\n\n**Example GDB Output:**\n```\n(gdb) x/i $eip\n=> 0x80484f5 <vulnerable_function+39>: mov    eax,DWORD PTR [edx]\n(gdb) x/s $ebp\n$1 = 0xffffd4d4 \"H\"\n(gdb) x/i $ebp+4\n=> 0xffffd4d4 \"Hello, \"\n```\nIn this output, we can see that the stack is corrupted, and the return pointer (eip) is overwritten.

This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute malicious code.\n\n**Vulnerable Code Output:**\n```\nEnter a string: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n```\nHowever, if we were to run this with a debugger like `gdb`, we could see the vulnerability:\n\n```bash\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /home/user/eng/overflow/overflow \n\nEnter a string: \nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x08048449 in process_input () from /lib/libc.so.6\n```\n\nHowever, we could run this directly with a very, very long string:\n\n```bash\n./overflow \"$(printf \"A\"$(printf \"\\\\0%s\" $(od -An -N 10 -tu4 \\\\\\$(n))\"...4096))\"\n```\n\nand it would show the `Segmentation Fault` Error.\n\n-- Let me give you another Example\n\nLet me give you an example using `gets()` function from previous example:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nvoid vulnerable_function(char* input) {\n    char buffer[10];\n    gets(buffer); // note: gets() is deprecated and should not be"], "idxs": [162, 235], "new_tokens": [521, 516], "wall_time": [12.730655431747437, 18.04697871208191]}], "tstamp": 1752402785.4103196}

The error \"list is not a valid object\" often appears when trying to use sympy or similar libraries to simplify expressions that are already lists or other compound data types, rather than sympy expressions.\n\nIn some data structures like sympy or a DSL (Domain Specific Language) in python, sublists are often specifically defined objects. If you have mode =\"LC\" in sympy, it may treat existing lists or sublists incorrectly, and cause this sort of error. Here are some potential solutions you could try:\n\n1.  Make sure that your input terms and subs are simplified correctly using, for example: \n    *   `simplify(your_sublst)` or \n    *   `sympify(your_list)` this will ensure that sympy produces expressions it can work with correctly. This option also allows lists of items to be handled by sympy correctly.\n\n2.  Verify that your'sub' values are sympy expressions, not lists of other sympy expressions. For example, \n    *   `sympify(subvalues)` turns a list of number into number sympy expressions.\n\n3.  Look at the code defining your belonging `sympy.Symbol()` and `rtol` variables), these might be overlaid on existing variables or lists that would cause items to develop objects.\n\nYou might need to explore your project setup. If your objects are stored in a different way, we will likely need to look into the code more (with collab and property viewer support) to resolve the issues.\n\nTo provide further assistance, could you please provide more details about your project? What are you trying to achieve, what are you using in terms of libraries, and what is typical input to methods when the problem occurs?", "The ability to add pages to the sales order search and show more than 1000 search results typically depends on the specific UI framework or e-commerce platform you're using. However, I'll provide a general outline of how you could achieve this in a few popular platforms.\n\n**Django and Django Admin**\n\nIn Django, you can override the `list_view` method in your `ModelAdmin` class to change the behavior of the search results. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n\nclass SalesOrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    #...\n\n    def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):\n        self.list_per_page = 1000  # increase page size to 1000\n        return super().changelist_view(request, extra_context=extra_context)\n\n    def get_changelist(self, request):\n        from django.contrib.admin.views.main import ChangeList\n        from. import views\n        return views.OrderList(request, self.model, self.list_per_page)\n\n# Register the model in the admin interface\nadmin.site.register(SalesOrder, SalesOrderAdmin)\n```\n\nIn the above code, we're increasing the page size of the search results to 1000. You can also create custom pagination to add pages to the search results.\n\n**Django Rest Framework (DRF)**\n\nIf you're using DRF to build your API, you can create a custom serializer or view to handle pagination:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import pagination\nfrom rest_framework import generics\n\nclass SalesOrderPagination(pagination.PageNumberPagination):\n    page_size = 1000  # increase page size to 1000\n\nclass SalesOrderList(generics.ListAPIView):\n    queryset = SalesOrder.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = SalesOrderSerializer\n    pagination_class = SalesOrderPagination\n```\n\n**Shopify API**\n\nIf you're using the Shopify API to integrate with your e-commerce platform, you can use the `limit` parameter to retrieve more than 1000 results:\n\n```bash\nshopify order browse/v1/orders.json?limit=1000&page=1\nshopify order browse/v1/orders.json?limit=1000&page=2\nshopify order browse/v1/orders.json?limit=1000&page=3\n```\n\nHowever, the Shopify API has a default limit of 250 results, so you'll need to contact Shopify support to increase this"], "idxs": [148, 136], "new_tokens": [371, 513], "wall_time": [11.115225791931152, 11.028458833694458]}], "tstamp": 1752402986.6561027}

If users don't provide feedback or interact with the system, how can you store and use the information they're communicating?\n\nIn theoretical terms, this problem is often associated with the \"silent learner\" issue. Essentially, if users remain mute, it's difficult for the system to learn or improve without any feedback or interaction.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, designers and researchers often implement strategies like:\n\n1. **Implicit feedback**: Using user behavior, such as engagement metrics or time spent interacting, as an indirect proxy for feedback.\n2. **Random sampling**: Selectively sampling users to provide feedback, either manually or through automated means.\n3. **Extrinsic feedback**: Providing users with incentives to share their thoughts, opinions, or experiences, such as rewards, badges, or sharing options.\n4. **Data scraping**: Using machine learning algorithms to analyze user data, such as search history or chat logs, to identify potential topics or issues of interest.\n\nHowever, without knowing more about your specific use case, it's challenging to provide a concrete solution.

When users provide feedback, you want to update or store the existing message with the feedback, but instead, you're getting a duplicate row.\n\nThis problem is often referred to as a \"duplication\" or \"redundancy\" issue.\n\nTo address this problem, you might consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Check for existing records**: Before inserting a new message or updating feedback, query your database to check if a message with the same `message_id` already exists. If it does, update the existing record instead of inserting a new one.\n2. **Use a unique identifier**: Instead of using `message_id` directly, use a unique identifier, such as a `record_id` or `feedback_id`, that can be incremented or generated for each record. This way, you can keep track of each record separately and avoid duplicates.\n3. **Merge feedback into existing record**: When feedback is provided, merge it with the existing message record. You can do this by updating the existing record with the new feedback and making sure to keep only one copy of the message data.\n4. **Use a deduplication strategy**: Implement a strategy to prevent duplicate records from being inserted in the first place. This could involve checking for existing records with the same `message_id` before inserting a new message.\n\nCan you share more about your database schema, data flow, or programming language?

It was first introduced in a paper titled 'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding' in 2018.\n\nHere's a simplified overview of how BERT works:\n\n **Key Components:**\n\n1.  **Transformer Architecture:** BERT is built upon the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. This architecture is particularly well-suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks and has a self-attention mechanism that allows it to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Pre-training:** Instead of being trained on a specific task, BERT is pre-trained on a large dataset of unlabeled text. This is done using a masked language modeling task where the model is trained to predict the missing word in a sentence, and a next sentence prediction task where the model is trained to decide if two sentences are adjacent in the original text or not.\n\n3.  **Multi-Layered Model:** BERT is a multi-layered model consisting of a stack of transformer encoder layers. This stack allows the model to learn complex contextual relationships between words in the input sequence.\n\n4.  **Staffed or pre training:**\nBase BERT:\n\t* Base BERT is BERT with 110M paraematers\nBrief  BERT-vs-big:\n\tBERT-base has (Layer, hidden size, and FFN Size are layers belonging to BERT transformer model): \n   Two layers, until layer  6 the hidden size increases ( 1024 items) the   another four layers  ( after layer 6 size 2048 items)\n\n5.  **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained BERT model can then be fine-tuned on a specific task, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition, to develop stronger task-specific models.\n\nThe fine-tuning aspect of BERT's design is one of its most significant advantages, as it allows for rapid transfer of knowledge from previously pre-trained models to a new task, resulting in better performance in a shorter amount of time.\n\nBERT has achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks and has become a widely used tool in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.\n\nIn simple words BERT is pre-trained language model with fine tune and best model for language vantage", "Here's an analogy for BERT:\n\n**BERT as a Very Knowledgeable Tour Guide:**\n\nImagine you're a tourist visiting a city you've never been to before. You hire a knowledgeable tour guide who's not only familiar with the city's streets but also has a deep understanding of its history, culture, and attractions.\n\nThe tour guide (BERT) has been hired by the city council to study the city's streets and attractions in great detail. They spend countless hours walking around the city, reading about its history, and learning about its architecture. As a result, they develop a comprehensive understanding of the city's layout, nuances, and hidden gems.\n\nWhen you start your tour with this guide, they share their vast knowledge with you. They show you the city's landmarks, explain the significance of its historical sites, and provide helpful tips on the best places to eat and shop.\n\nHowever, your tour guide isn't just a one-trick pony. They can adapt and adjust their tour based on your specific interests and preferences. If you're particularly interested in art, for example, they'll make sure to take you to all the city's top museums and galleries. If you're a foodie, they'll recommend the best restaurants and cafes.\n\nThis is similar to how BERT works. As a pre-trained language model, BERT has studied an enormous corpus of text data, developing a deep understanding of language, grammar, and context. When you fine-tune BERT on a specific task, such as question answering or sentiment analysis, it's like asking your tour guide to adapt their knowledge to focus on a specific area of interest.\n\nIn the same way that your tour guide might recommend additional sights or experiences based on your interests, BERT can learn to focus on the most relevant information for a given task, leading to improved performance and accuracy.\n\nThis analogy illustrates BERT's ability to:\n\n*  Learn from vast amounts of data (the city's layout and attractions)\n*  Develop a deep understanding of language and context (the tour guide's knowledge)\n*  Adapt to specific tasks and domains (the tour guide's focus on art or food)\n*  Improve performance through fine-tuning (the tour guide's customized recommendations)"], "idxs": [161, 96], "new_tokens": [511, 449], "wall_time": [12.57866096496582, 8.048171043395996]}], "tstamp": 1752403066.902964}

To merge King Crimson's style with Will.I.Am's voice, I'll try to create a verse that captures the essence of both artists.\n\nHere's my attempt at a Will.I.Am verse for \"21st Century Schizoid Man\":\n\n(Verse 3 - Will.I.Am)\n\"I'm a warrior in a world of pain\nWhere the noise is loud, and the noise ain't sane\nSystem's failing, and the people are acclaim\nThe lines are blurred, but I still maintain\nMy vision's clear, like a digital dream\nA world in chaos, but I'm the one who'll beam\nLight into the darkness, a revolution's theme\n21st century schizoid, it's a human scheme\"\n\nThis verse tries to reflect Will.I.Am's style, blending elements of hip-hop and pop music with the song's themes of social commentary and rebellion. Please note that this is an interpretation and not an official or authoritative addition to the song.\n\nThe original song is a powerful statement, and any attempt to add new content should respect the spirit of the original composition. The creation of new music is an ongoing evolutionary process, and I've made this attempt as a way to think creatively and pay homage to both King Crimson and Will.I.Am.", "Nas, known for his lyrical complexity and poetic flow, would be an interesting addition to the children's song \"Baby Shark.\" To blend Nas's style with the catchy tune, I'll try to create a verse that captures the essence of both artists.\n\nHere's my attempt at a Nas verse for \"Baby Shark\":\n\n(Verse 2 - Nas)\n\"In the depths, where the ocean does sleep\nLurks a predator, with a hunger to keep\nYou think it's sweet, but I see the gauge\nA system of scales, a different stage\nThe baby shark, a creature of might\nBut I see the trap, in the nursery's light\nA formula for fame, that's been witlessly tried\n Rhymes for toddlers, a soft blasphemy in the tide\"\n\nThis verse tries to reflect Nas's style, blending elements of hip-hop's storytelling tradition with the song's catchy melody and simple lyrics. I drew inspiration from the original \"Baby Shark\" theme and attempted to adapt it to fit Nas's lyrical flow. However, to make this work cohesively, a full reworked version with a professional producer could iteratively blend the new verse in ideally.\n\nNas's verse raises the bar for lyrical complexity and asked the simple lyrics of \"baby shark\" not to clash but to export mature, textured authority as possible well-known playful music of \"Baby Shark.\""], "idxs": [91, 94], "new_tokens": [361, 284], "wall_time": [7.262624025344849, 7.395754098892212]}], "tstamp": 1752403198.7115736}

Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n**What is LCS?**\n\nThe Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. Given two sequences (e.g., strings, arrays), it finds the longest subsequence that is common to both of them.\n\n**How does the code work?**\n\nThe code uses a recursive approach with memoization to solve the LCS problem. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The code initializes a 2D array `memo` of size `n x m`, where `n` is the length of the first string `text1` and `m` is the length of the second string `text2`. The `memo` array is used to store the lengths of the LCS for subproblems, which is referred to as \"memoization.\"\n2. **Filling memo**: The code fills the `memo` array with `-1` values, indicating that the subproblems have not been solved yet.\n3. **Recursive function**: The code defines a recursive function `dfs` (short for \"depth-first search\") that takes four parameters: `i` (index into the first string), `j` (index into the second string), and the two input strings `t1` and `t2`.\n4. **Base case**: If either `i` or `j` reaches the end of its corresponding string, the function returns `0`, indicating that there is no common subsequence.\n5. **Memoization**: If the subproblem has already been solved (i.e., `memo[i][j]!= -1`), the function returns the stored value.\n6. **Recursive step**: If the current characters in both strings are the same (i.e., `t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)`), the function recursively calls itself with increased indices (`i+1` and `j+1`) and adds `1` to the result, as we've found a common character.\n7. **Exploring branches**: If the current characters are different, the function recursively explores two branches:\n\t* `i+1` and `j` (ignoring the current character in the second string)\n\t* `i` and `j+1` (ignoring the current character in the first string)\n\tThe function returns the maximum result from these two branches.\n8. **Storing result**:", "Here's the modified code that prints the LCS string:\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public String printLCS(String text1, String text2) {\n        int n = text1.length();\n        int m = text2.length();\n        String[][] memo = new String[n + 1][m + 1]; // Two extra rows and columns for 2D array\n        memo[0][0] = \"\";\n        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n            memo[i][0] = \"\";\n        }\n        for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {\n            memo[0][j] = \"\";\n        }\n\n        return dfs(0, 0, text1, text2, memo);\n    }\n\n    public String dfs(int i, int j, String t1, String t2, String[][] memo) {\n        if (i == t1.length() || j == t2.length()) {\n            return \"\";\n        }\n        if (memo[i][j]!= null) {\n            return memo[i][j];\n        }\n\n        String res;\n        if (t1.charAt(i) == t2.charAt(j)) {\n            String lcs = t1.charAt(i) + dfs(i + 1, j + 1, t1, t2, memo);\n            res = memo[i][j] = lcs;\n        } else {\n            String s1 = dfs(i + 1, j, t1, t2, memo);\n            String s2 = dfs(i, j + 1, t1, t2, memo);\n            res = memo[i][j] = (s1.length() > s2.length()? s1 : s2);\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo make it work with your original LCS code, you'll need to make some minor modifications.

The error message \"Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: getFromCache is not defined\" indicates that the browser is unable to find a variable or function named `getFromCache`.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided manifest.json file, I notice that you have empty permissions listed at permissions[2] and also a misconfigured URL pattern in your content_scripts matches array which could also be causing potential errors in any scripts running.\n\nLet's address the potential error by ensuring that you have defined the `getFromCache` function in the content.js file. Here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. **Check the content.js file**: Ensure that the content.js file exists and it's accessible in the correct location. Open the file and verify that the `getFromCache` function is defined.\n\n2. **Review your code**: Double-check your code to ensure that the `getFromCache` function is properly imported or required in your JavaScript file.\n\n3. **Validate your manifest file**: Make sure that your manifest.json file is correctly formatted and has no typos.\n\n4. **Check for missing or outdated dependencies**: If you're using any external libraries or frameworks, ensure that they're up-to-date and correctly referenced.\n\nTo further troubleshoot the issue, you might want to:\n\n*   Check the browser console for any other errors or warnings.\n*   Review the content.js file to ensure it's properly exporting the `getFromCache` function.\n*   Test the content.js file in isolation to see if it runs without errors.\n\nOnce you've resolved the issue, the `getFromCache` function should be defined, and the error should be resolved.\n\nBelow is an example for the error to be corrected in your extension, This is just a basic example, and you would need to implement the functionality properly.\n\nBefore:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"tabs\",\n        \"activeTab\",\n        \"storage\",\n        \"\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"tabs\",\n        \"activeTab\",\n        \"storage\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAlso this URL pattern in content_scripts is not properly set up. The URL patterns must include a protocol to identify what network the pattern matches.\n\n```javascript\n\"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n        \"matches\": [\n            \"https://*.amazon.com/*\",\n            \"https://*.amazon.co.uk/*\",\n            \"https://*.amazon.de/*\",\n            \"https://*.amazon.fr/*\",\n            \"https://*.", "However, I need to clarify that without the content.js file, it's difficult to provide a fully functional popup.js file. But I can give you a basic example of how the popup.js file could be structured, assuming you're using the Chrome extension API.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might define the `getFromCache` function and use it in your popup.js file:\n\n```javascript\n// popup.js\n\n// Import the content script\nconst getFromCache = requireContentScript('getFromCache');\n\n// Function to handle button clicks\nfunction handleClick() {\n    // Get the user's input (ASIN)\n    const asin = document.getElementById('asin-input').value;\n\n    // Check if the input is valid (not empty, etc.)\n    if (asin.trim() === '') {\n        alert('Please enter a valid ASIN');\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Call the content script to get the price and reviews\n    getFromCache(asin)\n       .then((result) => {\n            // Display the result in the popup\n            const priceEl = document.getElementById('price');\n            const reviewsEl = document.getElementById('reviews');\n            priceEl.textContent = `Price: ${result.price}`;\n            reviewsEl.textContent = `Reviews: ${result.reviews}`;\n        })\n       .catch((error) => {\n            alert('Error fetching data');\n            console.error(error);\n        });\n}\n\n// Add an event listener to the button\ndocument.getElementById('check-button').addEventListener('click', handleClick);\n```\n\nThis example assumes you have the following HTML structure in your popup.html file:\n\n```html\n<!-- popup.html -->\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>ASIN Price and Review Checker</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        }\n        #container {\n            width: 300px;\n            margin: 40px auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n            background-color: #f7f7f7;\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            border-radius: 10px;\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"container\">\n        <h1>ASIN Price and Review Checker</h1>\n        <input id=\"asin-input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter ASIN\">\n        <button id=\"check-button\">Check</button>"], "idxs": [130, 75], "new_tokens": [520, 513], "wall_time": [12.98388957977295, 8.41686487197876]}], "tstamp": 1752403344.7913933}

Here's a high-level overview of the process:\n\n**Before you begin**\n\n1. You'll need a basic understanding of AWS services, including EC2, S3, IAM, and security groups.\n2. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage EC2 resources in your AWS account.\n\n**Step 1: Create an IAM role for EC2**\n\n1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.\n2. Click \"Roles\" and then \"Create role\".\n3. Choose \"EC2\" as the service that will use the role.\n4. Attach the necessary policies to the role, such as the \"AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess\" policy.\n5. Name the role (e.g., \"EC2-NodeJS-Service\") and create it.\n\n**Step 2: Create an EC2 instance**\n\n1. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.\n2. Click \"Launch instance\" and choose the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (or a similar Linux distribution).\n3. Choose the instance type (e.g., t2.micro).\n4. Configure the instance details:\n\t* Choose the IAM role created in Step 1.\n\t* Set the VPC, subnet, and security group (you can create a new security group if needed).\n\t* configure the instance's network settings (e.g., public IP address).\n5. Launch the instance.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Node.js environment**\n\n1. Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH (e.g., using a tool like PuTTY or the AWS CLI).\n2. Install Node.js and the required packages:\n\t* `sudo yum install -y nodejs`\n\t* `sudo yum install -y npm`\n\t* `sudo npm install express`\n\t* (other dependencies as needed)\n3. Create a new file for your Node.js service (e.g., `app.js`).\n4. Write your Node.js code in `app.js` (e.g., a simple Express.js server).\n\n**Step 4: Configure the service to run automatically**\n\n1. Create a new file (e.g., `systemd.service`) to define the service:\n\t```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=Node.js Service\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=nodejs\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n2. Save", "If you replace a single EC2 instance with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), you'll need to make the following changes:\n\n**1. Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**\n\n* Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click \"Auto Scaling\" in the left sidebar.\n* Click \"Create Auto Scaling group\" and follow the wizard to create an ASG.\n* For the launch configuration, choose \"Create a new configuration\" and follow the wizard to create a new launch configuration.\n\t+ Choose the same AMI and instance type as the original EC2 instance.\n\t+ Configure the instance details (e.g., IAM role, security group) as needed.\n* Set the desired capacity for the ASG to match the number of instances you want running (e.g., 1-3 instances).\n\n**2. Update the IAM role**\n\n* Make sure the IAM role attached to the ASG launch configuration is the same as the one attached to the original EC2 instance.\n\n**3. Configure the ASG**\n\n* Set the load balancing type for the ASG to \"None\" or create a target group and associate it with an ELB if you need load balancing (see below).\n* Configure the ASG's scaling policies to automatically add or remove instances based on desired capacity or custom metrics.\n\n**4. Configure ELB if necessary**\n\nIf you need load balancing, create a Load Balancer (ELB) and configure it to:\n\n* Create a new target group and specify the target type as \"EC2 instances\".\n* Add the ASG to the target group.\n* Configure the listener to forward traffic to the target group.\n* Optionally, configure additional ELB features like health checks, stickiness, or connection draining.\n\n**You may not need a LB:**\n\nIf your application doesn't require load balancing or if you're using an ALB (Application Load Balancer) or NLB (Network Load Balancer) that can be integrated with the target group managed by the ASG, you might not need a separate ELB in front of the ASG.\n\nHowever, if you:\n\n* Have multiple applications running on different ports or protocols.\n* Require SSL termination.\n* Need session persistence (stickiness).\n* Require granular control over access to your instances.\n\nYou'll likely need a separate ELB (Classic Load Balancer) to manage these features.

But for the sake of simplicity, let's assume you don't manage these services using a docker-compose setup, we can utilize the same path in your original script as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker volume inspect --format='{{.CreatedAt}} {{.Mountpoint}} {{.Name}}' nats_jetstream_data_4223\necho\ndu -hd0 $Mountpoint/_data | paste -sd '' - | echo - \"<\" $Mountpoint \"_data\" \">\"\n```\nRemember, the actual drive space usage of the Docker volume will remain afloat unless you either back it up or use garbage collector.

In simple terms, it estimates how long an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input increases.\n\n**Understanding Big O Notation**\n\nBig O notation is usually expressed as a function of the input size, 'n'. It describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity.\n\nHere are the common concepts of Big O notation:\n\n1. **O(1)**: Also known as \"constant time complexity.\" This means that the algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input.\n\nExample:\n\n- Finding an element in an array by its index: `arr[index]`.\n\n   Reason: If the index is known, no matter how large the array, it takes the same amount of time to access the element.\n\n2. **O(log n)**: This is also known as logarithmic time complexity. It means that the algorithm takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size.\n\nExample:\n\n- Finding an element in a sorted list using a binary search: `binary_search(arr, target)`.\n\n   Reason: If the target is in the list, the search takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the list.\n\n3. **O(n)**: Also known as linear time complexity. This means that the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the input.\n\nExample:\n\n- Finding an element in an array by iterating through each element: `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { if (arr[i] == target) { return true; } }` \n\n   Reason: If the target is not in the list, the search takes time proportional to the number of elements in the array.\n\n4. **O(n log n)**: This is a combination of linear and logarithmic time complexities. It's a common time complexity for sorting algorithms.\n\nExample:\n\n- Merging two sorted lists into a single sorted list: `merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)`.\n\n   Reason: This operation involves merging two sorted lists, which takes time proportional to the product of the two lists' sizes and the logarithm of the combined sizes.\n\n5. **O(n^2)**: Also known as quadratic time complexity.

Install Node.js from the official website if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/en/download/\n2. Install Visual Studio Code from the official website if you haven't already: https://code.visualstudio.com/download\n\n**Step 1: Install required packages**\n\nOpen a terminal in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Cmd + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux) and type \"Terminal\" in the input field. Select \"New Terminal\".\n\nInstall the `express` package, which is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create a new Node.js project**\n\nCreate a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nmkdir rest-server\ncd rest-server\n```\n\nCreate a new file called `server.js` and open it in Visual Studio Code:\n\n```bash\ntouch server.js\ncode server.js\n```\n\n**Step 3: Set up the server**\n\nIn `server.js`, add the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 8080;\n\n// Middleware to parse JSON payloads\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// GET endpoint to serve the template\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n    const template = {\n        id: 1,\n        sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n        choices: {\n            relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n            quantity: ['few','some','many']\n        }\n    };\n    res.json(template);\n});\n\n// POST endpoint to handle responses\napp.post('/response', (req, res) => {\n    console.log(req.body); // Print the received payload to the standard output\n    res.status(200).send();\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code sets up an Express.js server that listens on port 8080. It serves a GET request to the `/template` endpoint and responds with the specified JSON payload. It also handles POST requests to the `/response` endpoint, printing the received payload to the standard output and responding with a 200 HTTP status code.\n\n**Step 4: Run the server**\n\nRun the server by executing the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\n\n**Step", "Yes, this error is related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy in modern browsers. When a client (e.g., a web page) makes a request to a server that is running on a different origin (domain, protocol, or port), the browser will block the request by default.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to add headers to your server response to indicate that it can handle requests from different origins. This is done by adding the `CORS` middleware to your Express.js server.\n\nHere's how you can add it:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 8080;\n\n// Middleware to parse JSON payloads\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Middleware to enable CORS\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n    res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\n    res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept\");\n    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {\n        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET');\n        return res.status(200).json({});\n    }\n    next();\n});\n\n// GET endpoint to serve the template\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n    const template = {\n        id: 1,\n        sentence: \"This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives\",\n        choices: {\n            relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n            quantity: ['few','some','many']\n        }\n    };\n    res.json(template);\n});\n\n// POST endpoint to handle responses\napp.post('/response', (req, res) => {\n    console.log(req.body); // Print the received payload to the standard output\n    res.status(200).send();\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, we're adding a middleware function to enable CORS for all requests. This adds the required headers to the response. The '*' symbol allows requests from any origin.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more specialized package like `cors`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install cors\n```\n\nThen, in your code:\n\n```javascript\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\napp.use(cors());\n```\n\nBoth approaches will allow your server to receive requests from different origins and return the expected responses."], "idxs": [78, 94], "new_tokens": [517, 484], "wall_time": [8.573893785476685, 10.127472162246704]}], "tstamp": 1752403639.7228978}

This operation takes into consideration the structure (adjacency matrix) of the graph alongside the node features.\n\n- `input_shape[1] + 1`: This part refers to the input shape of the data. Specifically, it is getting the second element (index 1) from the input shape (assuming the shape is a list or tuple) and adding 1 to it. The reason for adding 1 could be due to a variety of reasons, but one common reason is that the node features may have an additional column for the node's index, degree, or any other constant value.\n\n- `num_filters`: This refers to the number of filters (or learnable features) in the convolutional operation. In other words, it's the number of new feature maps that the GCNConv layer will produce as output.\n\nSo, the line of code `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + 1, num_filters)` is initializing a GCNConv layer named `conv1` with `num_filters` number of output features, using the dimension of the input shape (plus 1) as the input size.\n\nHere's a simple analogy to help illustrate the process:\n\nImagine you're working on an image classification task using a Conv2D (Convolutional 2D) layer. In this case, the `Conv2D` layer is trying to detect features (like edges or lines) in the image. The `GCNConv` layer works in a similar way, but instead of detecting features in the spatial domain (i.e., left-right, up-down), it detects features that are influenced by the graph structure (i.e., relationships between nodes in a graph).\n\nHere's an example of how it might look in Python (using PyTorch), for a graph convolutional network with a single GCNConv layer:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import", "The difference between these two lines of code lies in the way the input shape is being modified to determine the number of input features for the GCNConv layer.\n\n1. `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + 1, num_filters)`:\n\n   - The input shape `[1]` refers to the feature dimension of the node attributes (e.g., node embeddings or node features).\n   - Adding `1` to the input shape means that the node features or attributes are padded with a single feature or dimension. The purpose of adding `1` could be due to a variety of reasons:\n     - To account for a constant or special value that needs to be added to the node attributes.\n     - To make room for additional features that are not yet present in the node attributes but will be used in future layers.\n\n2. `self.conv1 = GCNConv(input_shape[1] + edge_features, num_filters)`:\n\n   - The `edge_features` represent the feature dimension of the edge attributes (e.g., edge weights or edge labels).\n   - Adding `edge_features` to the input shape means that both the node attributes and the edge attributes are being used as input to the GCNConv layer.\n   - The key difference between this line and the previous one is that it now takes into account the relationships between the nodes in the graph by incorporating the edge features.\n\nIn general, when graph convolutional networks are applied to graph-structured data, they not only consider the node attributes but also the relationships between the nodes, which are represented by the edges. Whether or not to include the edge features in the GCNConv layer depends on the specific graph structure and the nature of the data being processed. \n\nHere's an example where edge features might be useful:\n\nSuppose we have a graph where each node represents a person, and each edge represents a friendship. If the edge attributes contain the strength of the friendship (e.g., `edge_features = strength`), a GCNConv layer that takes `input_shape[1] + edge_features` as input will consider both the individual characteristics of each person (node attributes) and the strength of their friendships (edge attributes).\n\nHere is an example of how it might look in code (using PyTorch Geometric):\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv\n\n# assume that input_shape[1] is 10 (number of features for each node)\n# assume that edge_features is 5 ("], "idxs": [131, 122], "new_tokens": [514, 515], "wall_time": [12.975712776184082, 12.44727611541748]}], "tstamp": 1752403665.2216334}

We define two functions, f and g.\n\n2. The function f from A -> B can be defined as:\n\n   f(x) = arctan x (for x \u2208 A)\n   \n   This function maps x from A to arctan x in the range (-\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2) which covers a quarter of the real line and is therefore a bijective mapping.\n\n3. To map the range to cover the whole real line, we extend the function f(x) to f'(x) using the following formula:\n\n   f'(x) = 1 + arctan (x-0.5)\n   \n   This ensures that the whole real line is covered.\n\n4. Similarly, we define g from B -> A:\n\n   g(x) = (x - \u03c0/2) / (\u03c0) + 0.5\n\n   This function maps x from B back to A.\n\nNow, considering the rules for a bijection (one-to-one and onto):\n\n1. It is one-to-one (injective): a unique x \u2208 A maps to a unique real value in R. If f(a) = f(b), then a = b.\n\n2. It is onto (surjective): for all values y in the range of the function, we can find a value in A (x) such that f'(x) = y. Since arctan(x) maps R to an interval from (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and we extended the mapping with a translation, now we map the whole real line to A.\n\nGiven that we have established a bijection between sets A and B, it follows that A = B, and their cardinals are the same.", "Given the interval (0,1), let's assume it's countable and enumerate its elements as follows: a1, a2, a3,..., an,.... We denote the set of these elements as A = {a1, a2, a3,..., an,... }.\n\nSince we are given that the set of real numbers, R, is uncountable, we can assert that there exists at least one element, x, in R that is not an element of A (or we can say not in A's enumeration).\n\nWe can re-express this assertion with the help of the concept of Ackermann set.

Here are some of the most important elements to look for:\n\n1. **Seat Height and Depth**: The seat should be adjustable to allow your feet to rest flat on the floor or on a footrest, with your knees at or below hip level. The seat depth should allow you to sit comfortably with your hips and back against the chair, with a gap of about 2-3 inches between the back of your knees and the front of the seat.\n2. **Lumbar Support**: A curved or contoured backrest can help maintain the natural shape of your spine and support your lower back. Look for a chair with a adjustable lumbar support that can be customized to fit your individual needs.\n3. **Armrests**: Adjustable armrests can help take pressure off your shoulders and neck by allowing you to rest your arms at a comfortable height. Look for armrests that are high enough to support your elbows and low enough to allow you to sit with a straight back.\n4. **Backrest Height and Angle**: The backrest should be adjustable to allow you to customize the angle and height to fit your individual needs. A backrest that is too upright or too reclined can lead to discomfort and poor posture.\n5. **Cushioning and Material**: A breathable, cushioned seat and backrest can provide comfort and support for long periods of sitting. Look for a chair with a breathable mesh material or a cushion made from a high-quality foam.\n6. **Adjustability**: A fully adjustable ergonomic chair can be customized to fit your individual needs and preferences. Look for a chair with adjustable seat height, armrest height, backrest angle, and lumbar support.\n7. **Weight Capacity**: Make sure the chair is sturdy and can support your weight.

When an object moves around a curve, its velocity is constantly changing direction, resulting in a component of acceleration directed towards the center of the curve (centripetal acceleration).\n\nLateral acceleration is essentially the perpendicular component of this centripetal acceleration to the direction of travel. It is the force that keeps the object on a curved path.\n\nThe formula you're referring to is v\u00b2 = r \u00d7 a, where:\n\n- v is the speed of the object,\n- r is the radius of curvature, and\n- a is the lateral acceleration.\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for speed, we get v = \u221a(r \u00d7 a).\n\nNow, considering the relationship between speed and curvature, if the curvature increases, the radius of the curve decreases. This means that to maintain a certain speed and follow the curve, the lateral acceleration must be greater to counteract the force that tries to straighten the object out.\n\nThe equation v\u00b2 = r \u00d7 a or v = \u221a(r \u00d7 a) indicates that as the radius of the curve (or the curvature) decreases, the speed must be reduced to avoid exceeding the lateral acceleration limit, which would cause the object to lose its direction and potentially fail to follow the curve.\n\nThis relationship helps explains that if the curvature is very tight (small radius) and you try to maintain a high speed, you might not be able to generate enough lateral acceleration to follow the curve correctly, potentially leading to disaster.\n\nKeep in mind that this intuitively makes sense when considering an object moving at a constant speed in a curve on an extremely rigid belonging to differentiate that one of mechanics until reverse), or race track, with a noticeable concave items.", "The concept of setting speed equal to the square root of lateral acceleration over curvature is a fundamental principle in the field of mechanics, specifically in the area of circular motion and centrifugal force.\n\nYou can cite several sources, but some of the most well-known and influential ones are:\n\n1. **Galileo Galilei**: His work, \"Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences\" (1638), laid the foundation for classical mechanics and includes discussions on circular motion and centrifugal force.\n\n2. **Isaac Newton**: In his groundbreaking work, \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (1687), Newton introduces his laws of motion and universal gravitation, which include the concept of centripetal force and its relationship to circular motion.\n\n3. **Leonhard Euler**: Euler's work on differential equations and calculus in the 18th century laid the mathematical foundation for many principles in mechanics, including circular motion and curvature.\n\n4. **_physicist-historian; Arthur M.

The adoption of new technologies often depends on various factors, including scientific breakthroughs, market demand, government policies, and societal awareness.\n\nHowever, I can offer some insights. There are already many successful examples of alternative energy technologies being implemented and integrated into our daily lives, such as:\n\n1. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, which are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels.\n2. Electric vehicles, which are gaining popularity and being supported by many governments through incentives and policies.\n3. Energy-efficient buildings and smart grids, which are being developed and implemented to reduce energy consumption.\n\nWhile there may still be technological advancements and challenges to overcome, the trend towards renewable energy and alternative technologies appears to be gaining momentum.\n\nInstead of thinking about suppression, I'd like to shift the focus to the existing progress and potential future developments in the field. There are many organizations, researchers, and innovators working tirelessly to improve and scale up alternative energy technologies.\n\nSome promising areas of research and development include:\n\n1. Advances in battery technology for energy storage\n2. Improved efficiency and cost of solar panels and wind turbines\n3. Developments in hydrogen fuel cells and other emerging technologies\n4. Increased focus on energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict exactly when or if \"regenerative alternative energy technology\" will be widely adopted, I encourage people to stay informed about the latest developments and innovations in the field.\n\nTo stay up-to-date, you can follow reputable sources, such as:\n\n1. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n2. International Energy Agency (IEA)\n3. World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\n4. Various scientific journals and publications focused on energy and sustainability.\n\nStay curious, and let's work together to promote a more sustainable and energy-efficient future!", "It's difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline for when Earth's markets will be ready for free energy disclosure. The concept of free energy, often referred to as zero-point energy, perpetual motion, or over-unity energy, is a topic of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the delay in the widespread adoption of free energy technologies:\n\n1. **Scientific understanding and validation**: Most free energy claims are still in the theoretical or experimental stages, and it's essential for scientists to rigorously test and validate these concepts to build confidence in their effectiveness.\n2. **Economic and cost considerations**: Developing and implementing free energy technologies would require investments in infrastructure, research, and development. Initially, these costs might outweigh the benefits, making it challenging for industries to adopt these technologies.\n3. **Energy storage and grid stability**: Free energy sources often require advanced energy storage systems to provide a stable and reliable power supply. Developing suitable energy storage technologies is a significant challenge.\n4. **Regulatory frameworks and policy support**: Governments and regulatory bodies need to create policies and frameworks that support the development and deployment of free energy technologies.\n5. **Public education and awareness**: Widespread acceptance of free energy requires educating the public about its benefits, limitations, and potential applications.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to develop and implement free energy technologies. Some promising areas of research include:\n\n1. **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE) devices**: Researchers are exploring the potential of ZPE, a theoretical concept that could provide a new source of energy.\n2. **Casimir Effect devices**: Scientists are studying the Casimir effect, a phenomenon that might be harnessed to generate energy.\n3. **Over-Unity Engines**: Researchers are working on developing engines that can produce more energy than they consume.\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict exactly when free energy disclosure will become a reality, I'd like to highlight some existing and emerging platforms and initiatives:\n\n1. **Excess Energy**: A platform that enables researchers to share and validate experiments related to over-unity energy.\n2. **Open Source Energy**: A community-driven initiative to develop and share open-source energy technologies.\n3. **Energy Research Centers**: Organizations like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) focus on advancing renewable energy technologies, including free energy concepts.\n\nStaying informed about the latest developments in free energy research can help you stay up-to-date on the progress being made.

To protect your keys from being compromised, it's recommended to use key files (key files that store the private key) instead of providing the password directly. The key files can be encrypted with a password and stored securely.\n\nIf you still want to use a command line argument to pass the password, consider using the ssh-agent and ssh-add tools or environment variables to securely pass sensitive data.\n\nIn Linux, you can achieve this by using the \"-i\" and \"-f\" flags to specify the key file for SSH and use environment variables to securely pass your password.\n\nHowever, the better way would be to use a secure key file as previously described. The code suggestion would look something like this: \n\n``` bash\n# This command will prompt you for a password. This is less secure\nsshpass -p \"your_password\" ssh -i my_private_key.pem user@host\n\n# This command will save your password in a secure file (.netrc) which will then be used by ssh\n# Remember that the.netrc file is not encrypted, so use this at your own risk.

However, we can use the `requests` library in Python to achieve similar functionality.\n\nThat being said, here is an example of how you can use the `requests` library to query a REST API in Python:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_data(url, params=None):\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the API with the provided URL and parameters\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n        \n        # Check if the request was successful\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        \n        # Return the JSON data from the response\n        return response.json()\n    \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        # If an exception occurred, print the error message and return None\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Set the API URL and any required parameters\napi_url = \"https://api.example.com/data\"\nparams = {\"param1\": \"value1\", \"param2\": \"value2\"}\n\n# Call the get_data function to query the API\ndata = get_data(api_url, params=params)\n\n# Print the response data\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `get_data` which takes a URL and any required parameters, sends a GET request to the API, checks if the request was successful, and returns the JSON data from the response.\n\nFor async programming you may be better off using the `aiohttp` library:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def get_data(url, params=None):\n    try:\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url, params=params) as response:\n                # Check if the request was successful\n                response.raise_for_status()\n                \n                # Return the JSON data from the response\n                return await response.json()\n    \n    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:\n        # If an exception occurred, print the error message and return None\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\nasync def main():\n    api_url = \"https://api.example.com/data\"\n    params = {\"param1\": \"value1\", \"param2\": \"value2\"}\n    \n    data = await get_data(api_url, params=params)\n    print(data)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nWhen using the `requests` library, it is generally recommended to handle exceptions and errors properly, as shown in the above code. You can also use async", "To use `await fetch` in Python, we would need to use the `aiohttp` library, as JavaScript's `fetch` is an async API and Python's standard library does not support async/await syntax for network requests out of the box.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use `await fetch` in a Python script using `aiohttp`:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def get_data(url, params=None):\n    try:\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url, params=params) as response:\n                # Check if the request was successful\n                await response.raise_for_status()\n                \n                # Return the response in text format\n                return await response.text()\n    \n    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:\n        # If an exception occurred, print the error message and return None\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\nasync def main():\n    api_url = \"https://api.example.com/data\"\n    params = {\"param1\": \"value1\", \"param2\": \"value2\"}\n    \n    data = await get_data(api_url, params=params)\n    print(data)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nThis will query the API at the given URL, and print the response data.\n\nIf you're using Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `await` syntax directly, but for other Python environments, you'll typically want to use `async` and `await` with the `aiohttp.ClientSession` to make async requests.\n\nHere's another example using `fetch` API with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. Since `fetch` doesn't have callbacks like node.js's fetch does, you might alternatively be able to achieve this with `async` and `await` syntax.\n\nLooking into thoroughly it appears `fetch` API isn't exposed in python quite yet;\n\nHowever we don't asked that question \n\n As previously noted; Thus it is likely better building thing as \n\nprevious solution,"], "idxs": [83, 99], "new_tokens": [514, 413], "wall_time": [9.084659099578857, 10.057795524597168]}], "tstamp": 1752404178.3506958}

It's essential to remember that muscle building should be done through a combination of resistance training, proper nutrition, and adequate rest.", "I'd be happy to explain the advantages of having muscle in more detail.\n\n**1. Increased Strength**\n\nHaving a higher muscle mass enables you to perform daily tasks with greater ease and efficiency. Muscles are responsible for moving your body, lifting objects, and performing activities that require force and power. As you build muscle, you'll notice improvements in your ability to:\n\n* Lift heavier objects without straining yourself\n* Carry groceries or luggage without fatigue\n* Climb stairs or hills with more energy\n* Perform activities like gardening, sports, or other hobbies with greater enthusiasm\n\n**2. Improved Body Composition**\n\nHaving a higher muscle mass can help to reduce body fat and maintain a healthy weight. When you build muscle, your body requires more energy to maintain and repair those tissues, which can lead to increased fat burning. This can result in:\n\n* A slimmer, more lean appearance\n* Reduced risk of developing conditions like obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer\n* Improved hormone levels, such as testosterone, which can support overall health and wellness\n* Increased energy levels and better overall health\n\n**3. Enhanced Metabolism**\n\nMuscle tissue requires energy to maintain and repair, which can increase your resting metabolic rate (RMR). This means that you'll burn more calories at rest, even when you're not actively exercising. This can lead to:\n\n* Increased fat burning and weight loss\n* Improved blood sugar control and reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes\n* Reduced risk of certain cardiovascular diseases, such as high blood pressure and heart disease\n* Improved overall energy levels and reduced fatigue\n\n**4. Better Bone Density**\n\nResistance training, which is key for building muscle, can also help to improve bone density. Stronger bones are less likely to break or fracture, which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and related conditions. This can lead to:\n\n* Reduced risk of osteoporosis and fractures\n* Improved posture and reduced back pain\n* Increased mobility and reduced risk of falls\n* Better overall health and reduced risk of certain age-related conditions\n\n**5. Improved Health Outcomes**\n\nStudies have consistently shown that individuals with higher muscle mass are at a lower risk of developing chronic diseases, such as:\n\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Heart disease and stroke\n* Some types of cancer (e.g., colon, breast, and prostate cancer)\n* Osteoporosis and fractures\n* Cognitive decline and dementia\n\n**6.

The query might look something like this:\n     ```sql\nALTER TABLE new_table\nADD COLUMN composite_key data_type, \nADD COLUMN description data_type;\n```\n     Replace `data_type` with the actual data type (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR(255)`, etc.) of your columns and `new_table` with the actual name of your new table.\n\n2. **Update the original table to include the composite key**:\n   If your original table doesn't have a composite key, you'll need to create one. A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify each record. If your table already has a primary key, you may need to adjust your queries to use both the existing primary key and the new composite key column.\n\n   To add the composite key to your original table, use the `ALTER TABLE` statement:\n     ```sql\nALTER TABLE original_table\nADD COLUMN data_type1 data_type, \nADD COLUMN data_type2 data_type,\nADD CONSTRAINT composite_key PRIMARY KEY (data_type1, data_type2);\n```\n     Again, replace `data_type1` and `data_type2` with the actual column names or the values that will make up your composite key, and `data_type` with the actual data type of those columns.\n\n3. **Update the new table to include the existing data**:\n   - Use SQL to insert the existing data from the original table into the new table, including the newly added composite key and description columns.\n     Assuming your original table is `original_table` and it has columns `column1`, `column2`, and `column3` (plus the new composite key and description columns), the insert query might look like this:\n     ```sql\nINSERT INTO new_table (column1, column2, column3, composite_key, description)\nSELECT column1, column2, column3, data_type1, data_type2 from original_table;\n```\n     Be sure to replace `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, `data_type1`, and `data_type2` with the actual column names from your tables.\n\n4. **Update the Kafka topic", "Here's an example of how to accomplish the task using R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Driver for Java) to interact with the database.

Based on the components listed, the system is trying to control some process or plant. Here's a brief explanation of each component:\n\n1. **To be controlled**: This is the system, plant, or process that the control circuit is attempting to control or regulate.\n2. **Actuator**: This component converts the control signal from the control circuit into a power signal that can interact with the system to be controlled. Examples of actuators include electrical motors, hydraulic pumps, and pneumatic valves.\n3. **Sensor**: This component provides measurement of the system output, also known as the process variable. The sensor detects changes in the system and sends the data to the control circuit. Examples of sensors include thermocouples, pressure gauges, and flow meters.\n4. **Reference input**: This component represents the desired value or setpoint of the system output. It sets the target value that the control circuit aims to achieve. The reference input is usually provided by a human operator or an external control system.\n\nThe missing components in the diagram might include a **controller** (which processes the data from the sensor and compares it to the reference input to generate the control signal) and possibly a **power source** (which provides energy to the actuators).", "These appear to be classification types for feedback control systems based on the reference variable w(t) or setpoint.\n\n1. **Set Point Regulation**:\n This type of control is also known as \"steady-state\" or \"position\" control. The goal is to maintain the system's output at a specific value, which is the desired setpoint (w(t)). The control system adjusts the actuator or control signal to minimize deviations between the actual output and the setpoint. This type of control is used in applications like temperature control in ovens or heating systems.\n\n2. **Reference Input Tracking**:\n This type of control, also known as \"tracking\" control, aims to follow a time-varying reference input (w(t)) as closely as possible. The control system adjusts the output to match the desired trajectory, even if that trajectory changes over time. Reference input tracking is used in applications like tracking moving targets with a robotic system or following a path with a autonomous vehicle.\n\n3. **Program Control**:\n Program control is a type of feedback control where the reference input (w(t)) is not a fixed setpoint, but rather a pre-programmed trajectory or a sequence of setpoints. The control system executes a predetermined schedule or a series of steps to achieve the desired goal. Program control is used in applications like robotic assembly, where the robot follows a pre-programmed sequence of movements to assemble a product."], "idxs": [57, 67], "new_tokens": [263, 285], "wall_time": [5.913317441940308, 6.888975620269775]}], "tstamp": 1752404417.8488023}

This involves:\n\n1. **Identifying a genuine pain point**: Ensure that the problem you're trying to solve is real, pressing, and resonates with your target audience.\n2. **Crafting a unique solution**: Develop a novel, valuable, and feasible solution that addresses the pain point effectively.\n3. **Iterating with customer feedback**: Continuously collect and incorporate feedback from your early adopters and customers to refine your solution.\n\nThis focus area has the highest impact because:\n\n* **Problem-Solution Fit** is the foundation upon which your entire business model is built.\n* **Validating assumptions** reduces the risk of investing years of time, money, and effort into a solution that may not meet the market's needs.\n* **A well-defined problem-space** informs your product development, marketing, sales, and partnerships strategies.\n\nBy prioritizing problem-solution fit, you'll be well on your way to ensuring that your startup addresses a genuine need, resonates with your target audience, and ultimately drives long-term success.\n\nHow's your current understanding of the problem-space? Have you established a clear problem-solution fit in your startup?"], "idxs": [64, 67], "new_tokens": [314, 292], "wall_time": [6.701929807662964, 6.878405570983887]}], "tstamp": 1752404547.9007654}
