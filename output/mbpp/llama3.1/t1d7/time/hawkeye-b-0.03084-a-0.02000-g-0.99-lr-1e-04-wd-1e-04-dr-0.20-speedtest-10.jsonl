When it finds a pair whose sum equals the target sum, it adds this pair to the result and moves both pointers to find the next pair.

It doesn't correctly handle the case when `i + 1` overflows (when we reach the maximum value that can be stored in the variable `n').

If it is not, it raises a TypeError. Otherwise, it returns the integer itself as the sum.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_of_integer(5))  # Output: 5\nprint(sum_of_integer(10))  # Output: 10\n```"], "idxs": [34], "new_tokens": [219], "wall_time": [3.1233792304992676]}, {"index": 8, "turns": ["Here's a simple Python function to get the sum of a non-negative integer:\n\n```python\ndef get_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the sum of a non-negative integer.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): A non-negative integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of the input integer (which is always the input integer itself since it's a non-negative integer).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input is a non-negative integer\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer\")\n    \n    # The sum of a non-negative integer is the integer itself\n    return n\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(get_sum(5))  # Outputs: 5\nprint(get_sum(0))  # Outputs: 0\n```"], "idxs": [22], "new_tokens": [175], "wall_time": [2.139435052871704]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Here's a simple function in Python that calculates the sum of a non-negative integer.

Here's a Python function that uses this approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is even using bitwise operators.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (n & 1) == 0\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how this works:\n\n- The number `1` in binary is `0001`.\n- When you perform a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `1`, you're essentially checking the least significant bit of `n`.\n- If `n` is even, its binary representation will have a `0` in the least significant bit. Therefore, `n & 1` will be `0`.\n- If `n` is odd, its binary representation will have a `1` in the least significant bit. Therefore, `n & 1` will be `1`.\n- The expression `(n & 1) == 0` will return `True` if the result of the bitwise AND operation is `0` (i.e., `n` is even) and `False` otherwise.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(is_even(10))  # Outputs: True\nprint(is_even(11))  # Outputs: False\n```\n\nThis function only works for integers.

The number `n` is converted to its binary representation.\n2. The bitwise AND operator (`&`) is applied to `n` and the binary representation of 1 (which is `0b1` or `00000001` in binary).\n3. If `n` is even, its binary representation will end with a 0, so the result of the bitwise AND operation will be `0`.\n4. If `n` is odd, its binary representation will end with a 1, so the result of the bitwise AND operation will be `1`.\n5. The function then checks if the result of the bitwise AND operation is `0`, and returns `True` if it is (indicating that the number is even) and `False` otherwise."], "idxs": [51], "new_tokens": [332], "wall_time": [4.680092811584473]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Here's a Python function using the bitwise AND operator to check whether a number is even or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given number is even using bitwise operators.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is even, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (n & 1) == 0\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the bitwise AND operator (&) with 1, which is a binary number 00000001.
