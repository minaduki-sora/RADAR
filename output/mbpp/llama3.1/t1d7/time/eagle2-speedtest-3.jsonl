Here is a Python function to find the longest bitonic subsequence:\n\n```python\ndef longest_bitonic_subsequence(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Create table to store lengths of longest increasing subsequence ending at index i\n    inc = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[i] < arr[j] and inc[i] < inc[j] + 1:\n                inc[i] = inc[j] + 1\n\n    # Create table to store lengths of longest decreasing subsequence ending at index i\n    dec = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n        for j in range(n - 1, i, -1):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j] and dec[i] < dec[j] + 1:\n                dec[i] = dec[j] + 1\n\n    # Initialize max_length to 1\n    max_length = 1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        max_length = max(max_length, inc[i] + dec[i] - 1)\n\n    return max_length\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding the lengths of the longest increasing subsequence and the longest decreasing subsequence separately. The longest bitonic subsequence can then be found by finding all pairs of sequences with a common index, and taking the sum of the longest such pairs. The final answer is the maximum sum.\n\nPlease note that the function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are copying the array into two new arrays, and then iterating through these arrays to find the longest sequences.\n\n**Example use case:**\n```python\narr = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]\nprint(longest_bitonic_subsequence(arr))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nIn this example, the longest bitonic subsequence is [1, 2, 4, 5, 2, 1]."], "idxs": [104], "new_tokens": [461], "wall_time": [9.413297653198242]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["**Bitonic Subsequence Function**\n====================================\n\nA bitonic sequence is a sequence of numbers that first increases and then decreases.

In Python 3.7 and later versions, you can use the built-in `in` operator to check for membership in a list which can be slower for searching the entire list.

This approach avoids the need to calculate the full factorial and instead only keeps track of the last digit.\n\nHowever, for larger input numbers, a more efficient approach can be used.

However, for very large input numbers, it may still exceed the maximum recursion depth in Python due to the limitation on the maximum recursion depth in Python.\n\nIn such cases, it's better to use the dynamic programming approach or the mathematical property of factorial to calculate the last digit in constant time.\n\nHere's a math-based approach that uses the properties of factorial to"], "idxs": [113], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [10.196785688400269]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["Here's a Python function to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number.
