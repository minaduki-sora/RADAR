Here's how it works:\n\n1. If `lst` is empty, return 0. This ensures that the function returns 0 if there are no sublists to consider.\n2. Set `max_length` to 1. This is the length of the first sublist, which is always at least 1 element long.\n3. For each index `i` in the range `0` to `len(lst) - 1`, consider the sublist `sublst = lst[i:i + 2]`.

We initialize an empty list `values` to store the extracted values.\n2. We also initialize a variable `start` to 0, which will keep track of the current position in the string.\n3. We then enter a loop that continues as long as `start` is less than the length of the string.\n4. Inside the loop, we use the `find()` method to locate the next occurrence of a double quote (`'`) in the string, starting from the current position `start`.\n5. If the `find()` method returns -1, it means there are no more double quotes in the string, so we break out of the loop.\n6. Otherwise, we use string slicing to extract the substring between the current position and the next double quote (inclusive), and add it to the `values` list.\n7. Finally, we increment the `start` variable to point to the next position in the string, so that we can start looking for the next double quote on the next iteration of the loop.\n8. Once the loop is done, we return the list of extracted values.\n\nYou can call this function with a string as the argument, like this:\n```python\nstring = \"'foo', 'bar', 'baz'\"\nvalues = extract_values_between_quotes(string)\nprint(values)  # Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n```\nThis would extract the values `'foo'`, `'bar'`, and `'baz` from the input string."], "idxs": [449], "new_tokens": [450], "wall_time": [31.502645254135132]}], "tstamp": 1755738219.0566423}
