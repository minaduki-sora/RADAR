If the input number is 1, the minimum sum of its factors is 0, so we return 0.\n2. If the input number is 2, the minimum sum of its factors is just the number itself, so we return 2.\n3.

If the input number is odd, we factor it by its largest factor that is less than or equal to the number.

This is a subproblem that we can call recursively, passing `n-1` as the argument.\n\t+ The sum of the factors of `n`. This is simply `n` itself.\n* We use the built-in `min` function to choose the smaller of these two possibilities, and return that as the result.\n\nNote that this function is an implementation of the cryptographic algorithm known as the \"factorial algorithm,\" which is used to factor large numbers into their prime factors.

We append this pair to the list of pairs, and then increment `i` and decrement `j` so that we move on to the next pair.\n* If `current_sum` is less than `target_sum`, it means that the current pair cannot be part of the solution, so we move `i` to the next integer in the array.\n* If `current_sum` is greater than `target_sum`, it means that the current pair is part of the solution, but it is the last pair we need to consider. We move `j` to the previous integer in the array.\n* Once the loop has finished iterating through all pairs, we return the list of pairs whose sum is equal to the target sum.\n\nI hope this helps!"], "idxs": [72], "new_tokens": [504], "wall_time": [7.128340244293213]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["```\nuse std::collections::HashSet;\n\nfn find_pair(array: &Vec<i32>, x: i32) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    let mut pairs: HashSet<(i32, i32)> = HashSet::new();\n\n    for (a, b) in array.iter().zip(array.iter().rev()) {\n        if a + b == x {\n            pairs.insert((a, b));\n        }\n    }\n\n    pairs.into_iter().filter(|x| *x == x).collect()\n}\n```\nThis function uses a HashSet to keep track of unique pairs whose sum is equal to the given number `x`.

The function uses two iterators, `s_chars` and `t_chars`, which iterate over the characters of s and t respectively. It initializes `s_chars` to iterate over the characters of s in alphabetical order.\n\nThe function checks if both `s_chars` and `t_chars` have a next element to iterate over. If both have a next element, it checks if each corresponding character is the same using the `allsame()` method. If all corresponding characters are the same for all pairs of characters in `s` and `t`, then the strings are permutations of each other and the function returns `true`.

If the sequence satisfies this form, it returns True.\n\nIf the sequence is not linear, it returns False.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with various sequences as input:\n```\nprint(is_linear([2, 3, 5, 7, 9]))  # False\nprint(is_linear([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]))  # True\nprint(is_linear([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]))  # False\nprint(is_linear([0,"], "idxs": [78], "new_tokens": [516], "wall_time": [7.695017337799072]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["```\ndef is_linear(seq):\n    n = len(seq)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if seq[i] + seq[i+1] > seq[i+2]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\nThis function takes a sequence as a parameter and checks whether it contains any three consecutive numbers that are in non-descending order.

If the current element belongs to a similar pair with both the first and second elements of the current pair and the absolute difference between the element and both of the elements of the current pair is less than or equal to 1, the current element is added to the result list.\n5. The newly formed pair is then removed from the input tuple.\n6. The process is repeated until all pairs of elements in the input tuple have been processed.\n7.

Since there are `n` elements in the array, the total number of pairs is `n ** 2`.\n* Next, the function loops over all possible pairs of elements in the array, using the formula `(i + j) % n` to ensure that each pair is unique. For each pair, it computes the sum of the two elements using the formula `(arr[i] + arr[j])`.\n* Within the loop, the function also computes the number of times each element appears in the input array, using the `arr.count()` method. In this way, it can determine whether the sum of the two elements is greater than `k`.\n* If the sum is greater than `k`, the function checks whether it is greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, the function updates the maximum sum.\n* Finally, the function returns the maximum sum found.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `max_disjoint_pairs()` function:\n```less\n>>> arr = [3, 1, 4, 2]\n>>> k = 5\n>>> max_disjoint_pairs(arr, k)\n10\n```\nIn this example, the function returns the maximum possible sum of disjoint pairs of elements from the array `[3, 1, 4"], "idxs": [80], "new_tokens": [514], "wall_time": [7.896708965301514]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["```\nfunc findDisjointPairMaxSum(arr []int, k int) int {\n    n := len(arr)\n    if n < 4 {\n        return arr[0] + arr[1]\n    }\n    pairs := make([][]int, n*n)\n    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {\n        for j := i+1; j < n; j++ {\n            pairs[i*n+j] = append(arr[i:], arr[j+1:])\n        }\n    }\n    var maxSum, maxStart int\n    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {\n        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {\n            if 2*i+1 == j {\n                continue\n            }\n            sum := 0\n            for _, pair := range pairs[i*n+j] {\n                sum += pair[0] + pair[1]\n            }\n            if sum > maxSum {\n                maxSum = sum\n                maxStart = j\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return maxSum + k\n}\n\n```\nThis function is solving the problem using sliding window approach.\nIt creates a 2D slice of slice of integers `pairs` of size n\\*n where n is the length of input array.\nThen it iterates through the slice and for each pair it checks the sum of the pair and if it's greater than previous max then update maxSum and maxStart.\nThe final answer is maxSum + k.\n\nIn the above approach, suppose we have an array [1,2,3,4], after first iteration we have following pairs : [1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]\nthen for pair [2,3] we have [3,4] and [4,3]\nso finally maxSum would be 8 (sum of all the numbers are 8)\nNote that it's guaranteed that there exist a disjoint pair whose sum is greater than or equal to (n-1)\\*k."], "idxs": [103], "new_tokens": [478], "wall_time": [10.08033800125122]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here's an example implementation of a function in PHP that finds the maximum possible sum of disjoint pairs for a given array of integers and a number k:\n```php\nfunction maxDisjointPairs($arr, $k) {\n    $n = count($arr);\n    $max = 0;\n    for ($i = 0; $i < $n - $k; $i++) {\n        for ($j = $i + $k; $j < $n; $j++) {\n            $sum = $arr[$i] + $arr[$j];\n            $max = max($max, $sum);\n        }\n    }\n    return $max;\n}\n```\nThe algorithm works by iterating over all possible pairs of elements in the array, where each pair consists of an element from the first $i elements of the array and an element from the first $j elements of the array, where $i + $j <= $n and $j = i + k.\n\nWe keep track of the maximum sum of a pair of elements so far, and update it for each pair we encounter.

The function takes two input parameters: the radius of the cylinder (`radius`) and its height (`height`). These values are used to compute the surface area of the cylinder.\n2. The function computes the surface area of the cylinder by multiplying its radius and height. Recall that the surface area of a cylinder is `2 * pi * radius * height`, where `pi` is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14. However, since we only want to compute the surface area to the nearest integer, we can approximate it by multiplying the radius and height and rounding down to the nearest integer. This gives us an approximation that is accurate enough for most purposes.\n3. The function returns the computed surface area of the cylinder as a float value.\n\nYou can call the function by providing the radius and height of a cylinder as arguments:\n```python\nsurface_area = find_cylinder_surface_area(5, 10)\n```\nIn this example, the function will compute the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 5 and a height of 10, and store the result in the `surface_area` variable."], "idxs": [55], "new_tokens": [399], "wall_time": [5.477025270462036]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Here's one way to write a function to find the surface area of a cylinder in Python:\n```\ndef cylinder_surface_area(radius, height):\n  # Calculate the surface area of the cylinder\n  surface_area = 2 * pi * radius * height\n\n  # Return the surface area\n  return surface_area\n```\nTo use this function, you would call it with two arguments: the radius of the cylinder and its height. For example:\n```\n# Calculate the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 4 and a height of 6\nsurface_area = cylinder_surface_area(4, 6)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(surface_area)  # Output: 50.29488481933113\n```\nNote that this function calculates the `pi` value using the built-in `math.pi` function, which is accurately rounded to 15 decimal places. If you need a more accurate value for `pi`, you can omit the multiplication by `2 * pi` and simply return `radius * height` instead.\n\nYou can also add error handling to the function to handle cases where the input values are not valid.

If the most significant bit is 0, then it means that the number is even.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```python\nprint(is_even(2))  # Output: True\nprint(is_even(5))  # Output: False\nprint(is_even(0))  # Output: False\nprint(is_even(42)) # Output: True\n```\nIn the example above, the `is_even` function returns `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers."], "idxs": [42], "new_tokens": [274], "wall_time": [4.230923891067505]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["Here is a Python function that checks whether a number is even or not using bitwise operators:\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    # Convert the number to its binary representation\n    bin = bin(n)[2:]\n    # Check if the number is even by checking if the number of 1s in the binary representation is even or odd\n    count = 0\n    bit_idx = 0\n    while bit_idx < len(bin):\n        if bin[bit_idx] == '1':\n            count += 1\n        bit_idx += 1\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function `is_even` takes an integer `n` as input.\n* It first converts the number `n` to its binary representation using the built-in function `bin`.\n* It then cycles through the binary representation, counting the number of 1s.\n* Finally, it checks if the count is even or odd by using the modulo operator `%`.\n* If the count is divisible by 2, i.e., `count % 2 == 0`, the number is even and the function returns `True`.
