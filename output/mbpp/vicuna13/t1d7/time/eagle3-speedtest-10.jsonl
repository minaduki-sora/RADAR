The `number` argument is a base-10 integer that we want to toggle the first and last bits of.\n2. We convert the `number` to binary using the built-in `bin()` function. The extra `[2:]` slice at the end of the string starts at index 2 and goes up to the end of the string, so it removes the `%` and `0b` prefixes and only returns the binary digits.\n3. We loop through each digit of the binary string, and for each digit we:\n\t* Convert the digit to an integer using the built-in `int()` function.\n\t* Use bitwise XOR with the value 1 shifted left by 7 (or 0b1111 in binary) to toggle the first and last bits. This has the effect of flipping the first and last bits while leaving the other bits unchanged.\n\t* Convert the result of the bitwise XOR back to a string using the built-in `str()` function.\n4. We join all the modified digits back into a binary string, with the original separators removed with the `[]` notation.\n5. We convert the binary string back to an integer using the built-in `int()` function with the base argument set to 2. This restores the original binary representation of the number with the modified first and last bits.\n6.

The mask `(num >> 31)` shifts the number to the right by 31 bits, exceeding the number of bits in the integer, so the result is zero, and xor with zero is equivalent to performing a bitwise inversion (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) on the highest-order bit.\n* `(num >> 31)` shifts the number to the right by 31 bits, exceeding the number of bits in the integer, so the result is zero.\n* The overall expression `(num ^ (num >> 31))` toggles the highest-order bit of the number.\n* `(num >> 31)` shifts the number to the right by 31 bits, exceeding the number of bits in the integer, so the result is zero.\n* The overall expression `(num ^ (num >> 31))` toggles the highest-order bit of the number.\n* The resulting expression `num ^ (num >> 31)` toggles both the first and last bits of the number.\n* Shifting the expression `(num ^ (num >> 31))` left by 1 bit and adding it to the original number (`num`) effectively toggles only the first and last bits of the number. This is because shifting a bitpattern to the left by n bits is equivalent to multiplying it by 2^n and adding the result of shifting a 0 to the left by n bits (i.e., 2^n - 1), and adding 2^n - 1 to a number effectively toggles the most significant bit."], "idxs": [91], "new_tokens": [467], "wall_time": [9.097592115402222]}, {"index": 7, "turns": ["Here is one way to implement a function in Python that toggles only the first and last bits of a given number:\n```\ndef toggle_bits(x):\n    # Convert the number to a binary string\n    bits = bin(x)[2:].zfill(32)\n\n    # Toggle the first and last bits\n    return int(bits[:8] + bits[8:][::-1] + bits[-8:], 2)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(toggle_bits(42))   # 11101010\nprint(toggle_bits(127))  # 01110111\nprint(toggle_bits(2047)) # 11001100\n```\nThis function first converts the input number `x` to a binary string, and then it toggles the first and last bits by concatenating the middle portion of the string with the end portion in reverse order, followed by the beginning portion of the string.

It uses the dynamic programming approach:\n```python\ndef lengthOfLongestIncreasingSubsequence(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [[9999999999] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    ans = 0\n    \n    # Start from the second element\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if j + 1 < i and arr[j] + arr[j + 1] < arr[i]:\n                dp[i][j + 1] = dp[i][j]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j + 1] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1] + 1)\n        \n        ans = max(ans, dp[i][i])\n        \n    return ans\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. We create a 2D list dp with dimensions (n marking the length of arr) containing 9999999999 (a large placeholder value).\n2. We initialize the answer to 0.\n3. We iterate over the indices i (skipping the first index) and within that, iterate over all possible j (up to i - 1).\n4. We have two conditions that could happen:\na. The subsequence between j and j + 1 is a valid increasing subsequence. In that case, we keep the dp value of j.\nb. The subsequence between j + 1 and i is a valid increasing subsequence, and adding the next element j to it forms a valid increasing subsequence. In this case, we take the minimum of dp values of j and j + 1, and increment dp[i][j + 1] by 1.\n5. We update ans as the maximum of its previous value and dp[i][i].\n6. The final answer is stored in ans."], "idxs": [87], "new_tokens": [465], "wall_time": [8.707683086395264]}, {"index": 9, "turns": ["To find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a given sequence, we can use dynamic programming. The basic idea is to build up the solution incrementally, starting from the empty subsequence.\n\nFor each position in the sequence, we can consider two possibilities: either we include that position in the subsequence or we don't. If we include it, we essentially double the length of the LIS, because the subsequence becomes \"longer\" by one.\n\nWe can represent the length of the LIS at each position using a two-dimensional array, where the first dimension represents the position in the sequence, and the second dimension represents the length of the LIS at that position (initialized as 0). We can initialize the first row and column of the array to 0.\n\nThen, we can iterate over the positions in the sequence and update the appropriate cells in the array as follows:\n\n* If the current position is greater than the previous position (i.e., we are considering including a larger value in the subsequence), we can take the maximum of the length of the LIS at the previous position and the length of the LIS at the current position plus one.\n* If the current position is less than or equal to the previous position (i.e., we are considering excluding a smaller value from the subsequence), we can take the length of the LIS at the previous position.\n\nFinally, we can return the maximum length of the LIS that we found, which corresponds to the last position in the sequence.\n\nHere's the function in Python that implements this approach:\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(seq):\n    n = len(seq)\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-j][j])\n    return dp[n-1][-1]\n```\nYou can call this function with a list of integers representing the sequence, and it will return the length of the longest increasing subsequence."], "idxs": [82], "new_tokens": [501], "wall_time": [8.22472071647644]}], "tstamp": 1755741098.756772}

The `sort_sublists()` function takes a list `lst` as its input.\n2. The function creates a new list `result` that contains a single element, which is the original list `lst`.\n3. The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly sort the sublists of `result` until there is only one sublist left.\n4. The `for` loop in step 3 iterates over each sublist in `result`, sorts the sublist using the `sorted()` function, and assigns the sorted sublist back to the current sublist in `result`. The `result[:-1]` slice notation is used to remove the last sublist in `result`, which has already been sorted, from the list.\n5. The `while` loop continues until there is only one sublist left in `result`, which is the fully sorted list.\n6. The function returns the fully sorted list as its output.\n\nYou can use the `sort_sublists()` function by passing it a list of lists, like this:\n```scss\nmy_list = [[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5], [1, 2, 5, 9, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]]\nsorted_my_list = sort_sublists(my_list)\nprint(sorted_my_list)\n```\nThis will output:\n```lua\n[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5], [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]]\n```\nNote that the order of the sublists"], "idxs": [72], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [7.246623754501343]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Here's a Python function that takes a list of lists of strings and returns a list of (sorted) sublists of strings:\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(lst):\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n```\nHere's how you can use it:\n```python\n# Example list of lists of strings\nlst = [\n    ['apple', 'banana'],\n    ['cherry', 'orange'],\n    ['grape', 'peach'],\n    ['kiwi', 'mango'],\n    ['pineapple', 'strawberry']\n]\n\n# Sort each sublist of strings in the list\nsorted_lst = sort_sublists(lst)\nprint(sorted_lst) # Output: [['apple', 'banana'], ['cherry', 'orange'], ['grape', 'peach'], ['kiwi', 'mango'], ['pineapple', 'strawberry']]\n```\nThe `sorted_lst` variable will contain a list of sublists, each of which is sorted in ascending order.
