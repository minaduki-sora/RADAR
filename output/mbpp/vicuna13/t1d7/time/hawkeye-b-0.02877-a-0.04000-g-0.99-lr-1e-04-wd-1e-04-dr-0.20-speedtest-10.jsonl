This is done by excluding `n` itself from the loop and incrementing `sum_divisors` for each divisor that is not `n`.\n* It compares the sum of the divisors with the value of `n`. If the sum is greater than `n`, then the number is abundant, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the number is not abundant, so the function returns `False`.\n\nYou can test the function with various input numbers to verify its correctness. For example:\n```python\nprint(is_abundant(12)) # True\nprint(is_abundant(10)) # False\nprint(is_abundant(14)) # True\nprint(is_abundant(20)) # False\n```"], "idxs": [67], "new_tokens": [466], "wall_time": [6.58047890663147]}, {"index": 3, "turns": ["Sure, here's an example Python function that checks whether a given number n is abundant:\n```python\ndef is_abundant(n):\n    # Multiply n by all positive integers up to its own square root\n    abundance = sum(5 * (i ** 2 + i) * n for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1))\n    # If the sum of those products is greater than n, it's abundant\n    return abundance > n\n```\nTo understand how this function works, let's break down the formula it uses to calculate the abundance:\n\n* `i ** 2 + i` is shorthand for `i ** 2 + i * i`, which is equivalent to `i ** 2 + i / i`, since `i ** 2` is non-negative for all integers i.\n* Multiplying each value of `i` by 5 and then by `n` gives a contribution to the abundance sum, because:\n\t+ 5 \\* i = 5i for `i` an integer, and\n\t+ 5 \\* i is less than or equal to 5 \\* (i + 1) for all integers `i`.\n* The factor `(i ** 2 + i)` in the formula gives a value of either 6 or 7, depending on whether `i` is even or odd. This is because:\n\t+ For even `i`, `i ** 2 + i` equals 6, because 2 \\* 2 + 2 equals 6.\n\t+ For odd `i`, `i ** 2 + i` equals 7, because 3 \\* 3 + 3 equals 7.\n\t+ Therefore, the total contribution of the factor `(i ** 2 + i)` is either 6 or 7 for each value of `i`.\n\nThe function therefore multiplies `n` by all positive integers up to its own square root, and then adds up the contributions from each of these factors. If the sum of these contributions is greater than `n`, the number is considered abundant.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\n>>> is_abundant(12)\nTrue\n>>> is_abundant(19)\nFalse\n>>> is_ab"], "idxs": [94], "new_tokens": [520], "wall_time": [8.997071981430054]}, {"index": 4, "turns": ["Sure, here's an implementation of a function in Python to check if a given number is abundant or not:\n```python\ndef is_abundant(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine whether a given number is abundant or not.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1 or n % 12 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(1, 12):\n        if n % i == 0 and (i > 1 and (n // i) >= (n // (i - 1)) or i == 6 or i == 7):\n            return True\n    return False\n```\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is an abundant number and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n* If `n` is less than 1 or is divisible by 12, then `n` is not an abundant number, so the function returns `False`.\n* Otherwise, the function iterates over the values of `i` from 1 to 11, and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, and if `n // i` is greater than or equal to `n // (i - 1)`, then `n` is an abundant number, so the function returns `True`.

If both operands are 1, the result will be 0. If one operand is 1 and the other is 0, the result will be 1. If both operands are 0, the result will be 0.\n* The `>>` operator performs a bitwise shift on an operand. Shifting a number to the right by 1 bit is equivalent to multiplying it by 2. Shifting a number to the right by 31 bits is equivalent to multiplying it by 2^(31)-1.\n* The expression `(number ^ (number >> 31))` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the number and its shifted version. This toggles all of the bits in the number except for the most significant bit (MSB) and the least significant bit (LSB).\n* The expression `(number >> 1)` performs a bitwise shift of the number to the right by 1 bit. This sets the LSB of the number to its opposite value (0 or 1).\n* The final expression `(number >> 1) & (number >> 31)` performs a bitwise AND operation on the number shifted to the right by 1 bit and the number shifted to the right by 31 bits.

In binary, a single bit can take on two values: 0 and 1. In Python, the numeric value of 0 is equivalent to the Boolean value `False`, and the value `1` is equivalent to `True`. So, if we want to toggle the bits of 1 between 0 and 1, we can simply return the value 0x55, which in binary is `11111111 11111111`.\n* If the input number has a bit length greater than 1, we can only toggle one of the two bits at the beginning and end of the number. To do this, we shift the input number to the right by half of its bit length (rounded down), so that the first and last bits are at the edges of the binary representation. We can then use the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to combine the original bits with a new value that has the first and last bits inverted.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n```python\n>>> n = 64\n>>> toggle_first_and_last_bits(n)\n128\n>>> n = 128\n>>> toggle_first_and_last_bits(n)\n64\n```\nIn the first example, the input number `64` has a bit length of 6, so we can only toggle one bit. We shift the bits to the right by half of the bit length (rounded down), to put the first and last bits at the edges, and then invert the bits at those positions.

['1', '2', '3'],\n... ]\n>>> sorted_lst = sort_sublists(lst)\n>>> print(sorted_lst)\n[\n    [\n        '1', \n        '2', \n        '3'\n    ],\n    [\n        'apple', \n        'banana', \n        'orange'\n    ],\n    [\n        'dog', \n        'cat', \n        'horse'\n    ]\n]\n```\nIn this example, the input `lst` is a list of three sublists, each containing a different type of data.

The function first converts the list `nums` to a set called `unique_nums`. This ensures that each number in the list appears as a unique element in the set, and that any duplicates are eliminated.\n2. If the length of the set `unique_nums` is 0, then the function returns 1, because a set with no elements has only one unique number (which is 1).\n3. Otherwise, the function uses the `reduce()` function to calculate the product of all the elements in the set. The `reduce()` function takes a lambda function and an initial value (2 in this case), and applies the lambda function to all the elements in the set to compute the product.\n4. The lambda function used in `reduce()` takes two arguments: `x` and `y`. It calculates the product of `x` and `y` and assigns the result to `x`. This ensures that the product is computed in a way that is associative and commutative, and that the result is returned after all the elements in the set have been processed.\n5.

If all elements of `array1` are present in `array2`, then the function will return `True` because `array1` is a subarray of `array2`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\n# Define two arrays\narray1 = [1, 2, 3]\narray2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Check if array1 is a subarray of array2\nresult = is_subarray(array1, array2)\n\n# Print the result\nif result:\n    print(\"array1 is a subarray of array2\")\nelse:\n    print(\"array1 is not a subarray of array2\")\n```\nIn this example, the output would be \"array1 is a subarray of array2\" because `array1` is a subarray of `array2`."], "idxs": [44], "new_tokens": [335], "wall_time": [4.440131902694702]}, {"index": 1, "turns": ["```\ndef check_subarray(array1, array2):\n    for i in range(len(array1)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(array1)):\n            if array1[i] < array2[j]:\n                return False\n    return True\n```\nThis function can be used by passing two arrays as arguments. It will check if the first array is a subarray of the second array by comparing the values of the corresponding elements. If any element in the first array is less than the corresponding element in the second array, the function will return False. If all the elements in the first array are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in the second array, the function will return True."], "idxs": [20], "new_tokens": [156], "wall_time": [2.0734362602233887]}, {"index": 2, "turns": ["Here is a Python function that checks whether an array is a subarray of another:\n```\ndef is_subarray(array1, array2):\n    if len(array1) > len(array2):\n        return False\n    for i in range(len(array1)):\n        if array1[i] not in array2:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `array1` and `array2`.

We do this by iterating over the nested tuples, checking if each element is even, and adding the index to the `even_indices` list.\n* Next, we use a generator expression to create a list of tuples where each tuple is obtained by unpacking the corresponding nested tuple at the even indices using the `zip` function. This is achieved by using a nested list comprehension that unpacks each even element in the nested list of tuples.\n* Finally, we return the resulting list of even tuples that were extracted from the nested mixed tuples.\n\nSo for the example provided in the prompt, the function call `extract_even_elements([(1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)])` would return `[(2, 6, 8, 2, 8)]`."], "idxs": [69], "new_tokens": [363], "wall_time": [6.635697841644287]}, {"index": 5, "turns": ["Here's an example function that extracts even elements from a nested mixed tuple:\n```python\ndef extract_even_elements(nested):\n    even_indices = [i for i, elem in enumerate(nested) if i % 2 == 0]\n    even_tuples = []\n    for i in even_indices:\n        even_tuples.append(nested[i])\n    return even_tuples\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a list of the indices of the even elements in the nested tuple.
