Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by them, the number of seats occupied by the administrators is 1 \\* 72 / 4 = 72 / 4 = 18 seats.\n\nNow, subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:\n\nTotal seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats\n\nNow, we have 54 seats available for the parents and students. Since one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, we can first find how many seats are left for the students. There are 2 / 3 seats left for the students:\n\n2 / 3 \\* 54 = 72 / 3 = 24 seats\n\nSince each row has 18 seats, and we have 24 seats available, we have 24 / 18 \u2248 1.33 rows for the students. However, we need to have whole rows for the students. Therefore, we will round down to the nearest whole row, which is 1 row with 18 seats.\n\nThe number of seats available for the students is 18 seats. We need to find how many students were in this group. Each student occupies one seat.
