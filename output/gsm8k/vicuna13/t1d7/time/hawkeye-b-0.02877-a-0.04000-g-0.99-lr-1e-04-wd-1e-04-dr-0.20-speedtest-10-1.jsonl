To do this, we can divide 6 by 2:\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\nSince half of Indras' name has 3 letters, we can write this using the subscript notation: Indras\\_3.\n\nNext, we'll find the number of letters in her sister's name. We know that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, which means her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. Therefore, we can write her sister's name like this: Indras\\_7.\n\nNow, we just need to find the total number of letters in both names combined. Indras has 6 letters, and her sister has 7 letters.
