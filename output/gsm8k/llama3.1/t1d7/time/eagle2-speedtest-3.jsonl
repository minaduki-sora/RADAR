If Carlos has 2x shells, Jim has 2x + 5 shells.\n\nWe know that Jim collected 27 shells. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n2x + 5 = 27\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives:\n\n2x = 22\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nx = 11\n\nThis means Carrey collected 11 shells. \n\nSince Carlos collected twice as many shells as Carrey, Carlos has:\n\n2 * 11 = 22 shells\n\nJim has 27 shells.\n\nTo find out how many shells each person gets if they divide the shells equally between themselves, we need to add the total number of shells they collected: 11 (Carrey) + 22 (Carlos) + 27 (Jim) = 60 shells.\n\nNow, divide the total number of shells (60) by the number of people (3):\n\n60 / 3 = 20\n\nEach person will get 20 shells."], "idxs": [79], "new_tokens": [282], "wall_time": [7.151001691818237]}], "tstamp": 1757097919.4024107}
