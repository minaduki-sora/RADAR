First, we need to find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it by:\n\n600 movies * (1/3) = 200 movies in series\n\n2. The remaining movies are not part of any series. We can find this by subtracting the movies in series from the total:\n\n600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies\n\n3.

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it by:\n\n400 movies * (40/100) = 160 older movies\n\n4. Now, we need to find out how many movies are normal movies. Since 160 out of the 400 remaining movies are older movies, the rest are normal movies:\n\n400 movies - 160 movies = 240 normal movies\n\n5.
