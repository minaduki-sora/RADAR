A large button is worth three small stickers and also worth one large sticker or three small buttons. \n2. A small sticker is worth one small button.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades:\nShe starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them, so:\n90% of 30 = 0.9 * 30 = 27\nShe trades away 27 small stickers.\n\nTo find out how many small buttons she gets from these trade, we know 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button. So she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.\n\nNext, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons:\nShe starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:\n\n50% of 40 = 0.5 * 40 = 20\n\nSo she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons.\n\nThen she trades the remaining large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many small stickers she trades for large buttons using her large stickers:\n1 large button is worth 3 large stickers, so 1 large button would mean 3 small buttons.\n\nWe are trying to find out how many small buttons she receives from her remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons:\nSince she gets 3 small buttons for one large sticker and since the problem states \"A small sticker is worth one small button\" - We must convert 20 large buttons into small buttons:\n\n20 large buttons mean 20 * 3 small stickers which means 20 large buttons = 60 small stickers. Now we know these 60 small stickers are actually equivalent to the value of 20 large buttons.\n\nLorraine gets 20 large buttons in exchange for 60 small buttons.\n\nSo, now let's compare the buttons she has:\nShe has:\n- 27 small buttons from the small stickers.\n- 20 large buttons from the large stickers.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many buttons she has and compare with the buttons given in the conditions:\nFrom the large buttons: large buttons = 20 buttons.\nFrom the small stickers: small buttons = 27 buttons.\n\nSmall buttons given in conditions: 3 large buttons = 9 small buttons, 60 small stickers or equivalent = 20 large buttons = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons."], "idxs": [512], "new_tokens": [513], "wall_time": [40.91459918022156]}], "tstamp": 1754544113.775572}
